# How to Provide Feedback


In Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), you can provide feedback by sending a smile or frown.

**To provide feedback**

1.  In the upper right corner of Windows Performance Analyzer, click the smiley face. A menu opens with two options.

2.  Select **Send a Smile...** or **Send a Frown...**. The Microsoft Windows Performance Analyzer Feedback dialog opens; the text in the dialog corresponds to the option you selected (smile or frown).

    **Note**  
    Steps 3 through 5 are optional; however, any feedback provided is helpful.

     

3.  Provide feedback in the message area.

4.  Check **Include screenshot** to include the accompanying screenshot of WPA, which WPA automatically creates when you opt to provide feedback.

5.  Check **Include email address** to include your email address, then enter your email address.

    **Note**  
    This field may be pre-populated with your email address.

     

6.  Depending on your feedback, click **Send a Smile...** or **Send a Frown...**.
