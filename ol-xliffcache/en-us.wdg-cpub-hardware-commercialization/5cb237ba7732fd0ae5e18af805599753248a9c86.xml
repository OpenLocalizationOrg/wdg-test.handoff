You can use DISM offline on a WIM or VHD file, or online on a running operating system.\n\nOffline servicing allows you to modify or service a Windows速 image entirely offline, without booting it first. This can reduce deployment costs because you can customize images to a degree before the operating system is deployed to the computer. In addition, if you have a stored master image that you want to make sure is always up to date, you can maintain it without booting the image.\n\nYou can also use DISM to service an image online. If you have to boot the operating system to install an application or test and validate the installation, you can boot to audit mode and add drivers and packages, or enable features and international settings.\n\n## <span id=\"In_This_Section\"></span><span id=\"in_this_section\"></span><span id=\"IN_THIS_SECTION\"></span>In This Section\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Add and Remove Drivers to an Offline Windows Image](add-and-remove-drivers-to-an-offline-windows-image.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Add or remove drivers from an offline image using either DISM or an unattended answer file.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Enable or Disable Windows Features Using DISM](enable-or-disable-windows-features-using-dism.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Enable or disable features in a Windows image using DISM.
