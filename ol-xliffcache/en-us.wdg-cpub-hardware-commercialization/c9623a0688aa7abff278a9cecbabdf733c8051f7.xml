The short answer to this commonly asked question is that the component store (WinSxS folder) contains all the components that make-up Windows to allow you operate your system. These components are kept to rollback any problematic change or to repair a file that becomes corrupted. For more information about the component store, see [Manage the Component Store](manage-the-component-store.md). For information on how to delete files in the WinSxS folder, see [Clean Up the WinSxS Folder](clean-up-the-winsxs-folder.md).\n\nFor operating system files, it can appear that more than one copy of the same version of a file is stored in more than one place on the operating system, but there’s usually only one real copy of the file. The rest of the copies are just “projected” by hard linking from the component store. A *hard link* is a file system object that lets two files refer to the same location on disk. Some tools, such as the File Explorer, determine the size of directories without taking into account that the contained files might be hard linked. This might lead you to think that the WinSxS folder takes up more disk space than it really does.\n\n**Warning**  \nSome important system files are located only in the WinSxS folder. Deleting files from the WinSxS folder or deleting the entire WinSxS folder might severely damage your system, so that your PC might not boot, and make it impossible to update.\n\n \n\nA new option has been added to the DISM tool for Windows 8.1 to help determine how much disk space the WinSxS folder really uses.\n\n**Analyze the size of the component store (WinSxS folder)**\n\n-   Open an elevated command window and type:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore\n    ```\n\n    **Note**  \n    The **/AnalyzeComponentStore** option isn’t recognized on Windows 8 and earlier.\n\n     \n\n    The information returned is:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Title</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Windows Explorer Reported Size of Component Store</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>This value the size of the WinSxS folder if computed by Windows Explorer.
