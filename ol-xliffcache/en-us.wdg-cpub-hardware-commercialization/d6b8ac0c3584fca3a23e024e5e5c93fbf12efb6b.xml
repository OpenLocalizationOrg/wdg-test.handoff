Packages help OEMs, ODMs, developers, and Microsoft all work together to deliver security and feature updates to your devices without stomping on each other's work.\n\nThis guide is written toward OEMs, but ODMs and developers can use the same processes to test IoT Core apps, drivers, board support packages (BSPs).\n\n## <span id=\"Scenarios\"></span><span id=\"scenarios\"></span><span id=\"SCENARIOS\"></span>Scenarios\n\n\nWant to jump right in?

In general terms:\n1.  Add each of your customizations (drivers, apps, settings) into signed package files.\n2.  Create a summary list of these packages, called a feature manifest (FM), which lists your packages by feature name.\n3.  Get IoT Core's packages and FMs from us.\n4.  Get the packages and FMs from your hardware manufacturer, such as a board support package (BSP) and the BSPFM.\n5.  List the FMs and features you want to install in an OEMInput file.\n6.  Create a flashable image file (FFU) using ImgGen and the OEMInput file.\n7.  Flash the image to your devices.\n\n![iot core image creation process](images/oemworkflow.png)\n\n### <span id=\"Packages\"></span><span id=\"packages\"></span><span id=\"PACKAGES\"></span>Packages\n\nPackages are the logical building blocks of IoT Core. They contain all the files, libraries, registry settings, executables, and data on the device. From device drivers to system files, every component must be contained in a package. This modular architecture allows for precise control of updates: a package is the smallest serviceable unit on the device.\n\nEach package contains:\n-   The contents of the package, such as a signed driver binary or a signed appx binary.\n-   A package definition (.pkg.xml) file specifies the contents of the package and where they should be placed in the final image. See %SRC\\_DIR%\\\\Packages\\\\ directory for various samples of package files.\n-   A signature. This can be a test or retail certificate.\n\nThe `pkggen` tool combines these items into signed packages. Our samples include scripts: `createpkg`, `createprovpkg` and `createupdatepkgs`, which call pkggen to create packages for our drivers, apps, and settings.\n\nThe process is similar to that used by Windows 10 Mobile. To learn more about creating packages, see [Creating mobile packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn756642).\n\n### <span id=\"Feature_manifests__FMs_\"></span><span id=\"feature_manifests__fms_\"></span><span id=\"FEATURE_MANIFESTS__FMS_\"></span>Feature manifests (FMs)\n\nAfter you've put everything into packages, you'll use FM files to list which of your packages belong in the final image.\n\nYou can use as many FMs into an image as you want. In this guide, we refer to the following FMs:\n\n-   **OEMFM.xml** includes features an OEM might add to a device, such as the app and a provisioning package.\n-   **BSPFM.xml** includes features that a hardware manufacturer might use to define a board. For example, OEM\\_RPi2FM.xml includes all of the features used for the Raspberry Pi 2.\n-   **ProdFM.xml** includes features that make up IoT Core. ProdFM refers to a fully-signed version of the OS.\n\nThe process is similar to that used by Windows 10 Mobile. To learn more, see [Feature manifest file contents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn756745).\n\nYou'll list which of the features to add by using these tags:\n\n-   &lt;BasePackages&gt;: Packages that you always included in your images, for example, your base app.\n-   &lt;Features&gt;\\\\&lt;OEM&gt;: Other individual packages that might be specific to a particular product design.\n\n### <span id=\"Creating_the_image__ImgGen_and_the_image_configuration_file__OEMInput.xml_\"></span><span id=\"creating_the_image__imggen_and_the_image_configuration_file__oeminput.xml_\"></span><span id=\"CREATING_THE_IMAGE__IMGGEN_AND_THE_IMAGE_CONFIGURATION_FILE__OEMINPUT.XML_\"></span>Creating the image: ImgGen and the image configuration file (OEMInput.xml)\n\nTo create the final image, you'll use the `imggen` tool with an image configuration file, **OEMInput.xml file**.\n\nThese are the same tools used to create Windows 10 Mobile images. To learn more, see [OEMInput file contents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn756778).\n\nThe image configuration file lists:\n\n-   The feature manifests (FMs) and the packages that you want to install from each one.\n-   An **SoC** chip identifier, which is used to help set up the device partitions. This value is required, even if you're not using one of the devices listed. Start with the value for the hardware that most closely resembles your device:\n\n    **RPi2**: Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 3 (ARM)\n\n    **MBM**: Intel Minnowboard Max (x86)\n\n    **DB**: Qualcomm DragonBoard (ARM32)\n\n-   The ReleaseType (either **Production** or **Test**).\n\n    **Retail builds**: We recommend creating retail images early on in your development process to verify that everything will work when you are ready to ship.\n\n    These builds contain all of the security features enabled.\n\n    To use this build type, all of your code must be signed using retail (not test) code signing certificates.\n\n    For a sample, see %SRC\\_DIR%\\\\Products\\\\SampleA\\\\RetailOEMInput.xml.\n\n    **Test builds**: Use these to try out new versions of your apps and drivers created by you and your hardware manufacturer partners.\n\n    These builds have some security features disabled, which allows you to use either test-signed or production-signed packages.\n\n    These builds also include developer tools such as debug transport, SSH, and PowerShell, that you can use to help troubleshoot issues.\n\n    For a sample, see %SRC\\_DIR%\\\\Products\\\\SampleA\\\\TestOEMInput.xml.\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\"></th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Retail builds</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Test builds</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\">Image release type</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">ReleaseType: <strong>Production</strong></td>\n    <td align=\"left\">ReleaseType: <strong>Test</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\">Package release type</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">Only Production Type packages are supported</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">Both Production Type or Test Type are supported</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\">Test-signed packages</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">Not supported</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">Supported.\n    <p>IOT_ENABLE_TESTSIGNING feature must be included.</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\">Code integrity check</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">Supported.

The board manufacturer may periodically provide updates for the board, which your devices can receive and apply. \n\nIn [Lab 2a: Replace a driver in an existing board support package](replace-a-driver-in-an-existing-bsp.md), you modify a BSP by adding our own drivers. When you do this, you become the new owner for the new, modified BSP. If the original BSP hardware manufacturer provides any updates to the board, you'll need to choose whether to pass the updates on to your own boards.\n\n\n\n## <span id=\"OK__let_s_try_it_\"></span><span id=\"ok__let_s_try_it_\"></span><span id=\"OK__LET_S_TRY_IT_\"></span>OK, let's try it!\n\n\nStart here: [Get the tools needed to customize Windows IoT Core](set-up-your-pc-to-customize-iot-core.md).\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n[Learn about Windows 10 IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/IoTCore.htm)\n\n[IoT Core Developer Resources](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot)\n\n[What's in the Windows ADK IoT Core Add-ons](iot-core-adk-addons.md)\n\n[IoT Core feature list](iot-core-feature-list.md)\n\n[IoT Core Add-ons command-line options](iot-core-adk-addons-command-line-options.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
