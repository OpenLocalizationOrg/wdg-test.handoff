# Configure Windows Server Roles


To configure one or more Server Roles during an unattended installation, you can use the PowerShell or Server Manager command-line tool. For more information about Server Roles, see this [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=140100).

You can create `FirstLogonCommands` in your answer file that specifies the proper parameters for the server role you want to configure. The `FirstLogonCommands` setting is configured in the [oobeSystem](oobesystem.md) configuration pass. The `FirstLogonCommands` setting is run immediately after a user logs onto the computer and before the desktop is displayed.

**Note**  
You must run PowerShell and Server Manager commands from an account with administrator privileges.

 

For more information about adding the `FirstLogonCommands` setting, see [Add a Custom Command to an Answer File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915058).

The following example shows the PowerShell.exe syntax for installing the ServerManager module and the DHCP, FAX, DNS, and File-Services roles.

``` syntax
<FirstLogonCommands>
   <SynchronousCommand wcm:action="add">
      <Order>1</Order>
      <CommandLine> Powershell.exe –command Import-Module ServerManager; Install-WindowsFeature DHCP,FAX,DNS,File-Services</CommandLine>
      <Description>Configure Server Role</Description>
   </SynchronousCommand>
</FirstLogonCommands>
```

**Note**  
Not all server roles support Sysprep. You must configure some server roles after imaging and deployment. For more information, see [Sysprep Support for Server Roles](sysprep-support-for-server-roles.md).
