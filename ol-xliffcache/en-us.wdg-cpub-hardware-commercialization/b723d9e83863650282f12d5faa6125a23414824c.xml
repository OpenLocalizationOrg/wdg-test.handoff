This enables you to more easily review the actions that occurred during Windows Setup and to review the performance statistics for different parts of Windows Setup. You can filter the log so as to view only relevant items that you are interested in. The Windows Setup performance events are saved into a log file that is named Setup.etl, which is available in the %WINDIR%\\\\Panther directory of all installations. To view the logs, you must use the Event Viewer included with the Windows media that corresponds to the version of the customized image that you are building.\n\nTo view the logs on a computer that does not include the corresponding kit, you must run a script from the root of the media that installs the Event Trace for Windows (ETW) provider. From the command line, type:\n\n``` syntax\nCscript D:\\sources\\etwproviders\\etwproviderinstall.vbs install D:\\sources\\etwproviders\n```\n\nwhere *D* is the drive letter of the Windows DVD media.\n\n### <span id=\"To_view_the_Windows_Setup_event_logs\"></span><span id=\"to_view_the_windows_setup_event_logs\"></span><span id=\"TO_VIEW_THE_WINDOWS_SETUP_EVENT_LOGS\"></span>To view the Windows Setup event logs\n\n1.  Start the Event Viewer, expand the Windows Logs node, and then click **System**.\n\n2.  In the **Actions** pane, click **Open Saved Log** and then locate the Setup.etl file.
