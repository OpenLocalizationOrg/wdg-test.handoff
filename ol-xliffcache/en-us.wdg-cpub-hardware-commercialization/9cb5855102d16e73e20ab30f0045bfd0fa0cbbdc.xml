default restore only drivers (installed through INF packages) and preinstalled Windows apps. To configure the features to restore other customizations such as settings and Classic Windows applications, you will need to prepare one or more customization packages which contain the customizations. These customizations packages are in the form of provisioning packages (.ppkg).\n\nPush-button reset features look for and automatically restore provisioning packages which are located in the folder C:\\\\Recovery\\\\Customizations.\n\nTo protect the packages from tampering or accidental deletion, the Write/Modify permissions of C:\\\\Recovery\\\\Customizations should be restricted to the local Administrators user group.\n\nSome settings and customizations cannot be included in provisioning packages. Instead, you can restore them using an unattend file applied using the Push-button reset extensibility scripts. For settings which are supported by both provisioning packages and unattend, it is recommended that you specify them using only one of the mechanisms, not both. To learn more, see [How push-button reset features work](how-push-button-reset-features-work.md).\n\n## <span id=\"Capturing_Classic_Windows_applications_using_Windows_User_State_Migration_Tool__USMT__s_ScanState_tool\"></span><span id=\"capturing_classic_windows_applications_using_windows_user_state_migration_tool__usmt__s_scanstate_tool\"></span><span id=\"CAPTURING_CLASSIC_WINDOWS_APPLICATIONS_USING_WINDOWS_USER_STATE_MIGRATION_TOOL__USMT__S_SCANSTATE_TOOL\"></span>Capturing Classic Windows applications using Windows User State Migration Tool (USMT)'s ScanState tool\n\n\nThe Windows User State Migration Tool (USMT) ScanState.exe has been updated in Windows 10 to support capturing Classic Windows applications applications. This functionality can be activated by specifying the `/apps` option.\n\nWhen `/apps` is specified, ScanState uses a set of application discovery rules to determine what should be captured, and stores the output as a reference device data image inside a provisioning package. In general, the reference device data includes the following:\n\n-   Classic Windows applications installed using either Microsoft Windows Installer or other installers\n-   All files and folders outside of the Windows namespace (in other words, outside of \\\\Windows, \\\\Program Files, \\\\Program Files (x86), \\\\ProgramData, and \\\\Users). This applies only to the volume on which Windows is installed.\n-   Not captured: Windows apps.\n-   Not captured: User state/data.\n\nYou can also specify additional rules to include or exclude specific files, folders, and registry settings. For example, if you are using ScanState during factory deployment, you might need to exclude manufacturing-specific tools so that they will not be restored when end users use Push-button reset features. To specify additional rules, you will need to author a migration XML and specify the `/i` option when using ScanState.exe.\n\nScanState’s /apps option also supports the following optional parameters:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Parameter</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Use</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><code>+/-sysdrive</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Specifies whether applications, files, and folders outside of the Windows namespace should be captured.\n<p>If <code>+sysdrive</code> is specified, all contents on the system drive are examined and eligible to be captured according to the discovery rules.</p>\n<p>If <code>-sysdrive</code> is specified, only contents within the Windows namespace are examined and eligible to be captured according to the discovery rules.</p>\n<p><code>+sysdrive</code> is the default.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><code>+/-oeminfo</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Specifies whether the OEM-specific help and support info should be captured.\n<p>If <code>+oeminfo</code> is specified, OEM and support info are captured.</p>\n<p>If <code>-oeminfo</code> is specified, OEM and support info are not captured.</p>\n<p><code>+oeminfo</code> is the default.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n**Important**  \n-   Although push-button reset features can restore multiple provisioning packages, only one of the packages can contain reference device data image captured using ScanState.\n-   ScanState should be used only after all customizations have been applied to the PC. It does not support appending additional changes to an existing reference device data image.\n-   A provisioning package captured using ScanState.exe can only be applied using push-button reset features and deployment media created using Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD). It cannot be applied using tools such as DISM or USMT’s LoadState.exe.\n-   When you prepare ScanState for capturing customizations, you should exclude Windows Defender settings to prevent possible failures during recovery that can be caused by file conflicts.

Instead, you will need to use the Push-button reset extensibility points in order to restore them during recovery. These extensibility points allow you run scripts which can:\n\n-   Inject an unattend.xml into the recovered OS\n-   Copy other configuration files and assets into the recovered OS\n\n**Important**  \n-   You should not use unattend.xml (or other mechanisms) to boot the recovered OS into Audit Mode. The recovered OS must remain configured to boot to OOBE.\n-   A copy of the configuration files and assets which need to be restored must be placed under C:\\\\Recovery\\\\OEM. Contents in this folder are not modified by push-button reset features and are automatically backed up to recovery media created using the **Create a recovery drive** utility. To protect the unattend.xml and configuration files/assets from tampering or accidental deletion, Write/Modify permissions of C:\\\\Recovery\\\\OEM should be restricted to the local Administrators user group.\n\n \n\nTo learn how to author scripts to be run using extensibility points, see [Add a script to push-button reset features](add-a-script-to-push-button-reset-features.md).\n\nTo learn how to use ScanState to capture and store the resulting PPKG under C:\\\\Recovery\\\\Customizations, which is restored automatically during PBR, see [Deploy push-button reset features using ScanState](deploy-push-button-reset-features.md).\n\n## <span id=\"Recovery_strategies_for_common_customizations\"></span><span id=\"recovery_strategies_for_common_customizations\"></span><span id=\"RECOVERY_STRATEGIES_FOR_COMMON_CUSTOMIZATIONS\"></span>Recovery strategies for common customizations\n\n\nThe following table outlines the recovery strategy for common customizations which are described in the User Experience Windows Engineering Guide (UX WEG) as well as those covered in the OEM Policy Document (OPD).
