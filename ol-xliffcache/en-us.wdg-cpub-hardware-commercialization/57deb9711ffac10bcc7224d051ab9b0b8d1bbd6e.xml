This assessment runs a series of transcode operations that have common input and output file formats and resolutions. For more information about the assessment results and issues that might be found, see [Results for the Media Transcoding Performance Assessment](results-for-the-media-transcoding-performance-assessment.md)\n\nThe following graphic illustrates the assessment process.\n\n![workflow for media transcoding performance](images/dep-win8-8-techref-mediatranscodingflow.jpg)\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [System Requirements](#bkmk-sysreq)\n\n-   [Settings](#assesssettings)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-sysreq\"></a>System Requirements\n\n\nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\nRun this assessment only while the desktop is full screen. Do not run this assessment if you have another Windows Store app opened side-by-side with the desktop.\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems.\n\nThere are two ways to run this assessment on Windows RT:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows Assessment Console, and then run it on Windows RT. For more information, see [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services to run assessments on Windows RT. For more information, see [Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"assesssettings\"></a>Settings\n\n\nBy default, this assessment uses the recommended settings. Microsoft defines these settings so that you can compare the results across multiple computer configurations or over time on the same computer.
