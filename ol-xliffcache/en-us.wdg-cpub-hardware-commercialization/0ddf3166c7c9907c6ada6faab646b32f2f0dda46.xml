Services server](#bkmk-ts-msmq)\n\n-   [The dumps folder does not contain any dump files](#bkmk-ts-dumps)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-logfiles\"></a>Log files\n\n\n-   Log files are copied to the server when you add computers to the server inventory. They are stored at **C:\\\\relax\\\\logs**.\n\n-   A server log captures events of the Windows Assessment Services. This log file can be found at **C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\relaxservice.tracelistener.Tracing**.\n\n-   Errors coming from the UI can be viewed in the Event Viewer on the client computer under **Applications and Services Logs** - **Windows Assessment Services Client**. The log file is an ETL file located at **%systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\Winevt\\\\Logs\\\\Windows Assessment Services Client.evtx**.\n\n-   Image deployment logs (Windows PE) are copied from the test computers to **%SystemDrive%\\\\relax\\\\logs**\n\n-   On Windows Server 2012, Windows Deployment Services (Windows DS) issues can be found in the Event Viewer under **Applications and Services Logs** -**Microsoft** -**Windows** - **Windows Deployment Services Diagnostics**.\n\n-   On Windows Server 2008 R2 you must enable Windows DS logging by setting the following:\n\n    -   **HKLM\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\WDSServer\\\\Providers\\\\WDSPXE!TracingDisabled to 0**\n\n    -   **HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Tracing\\\\WDSServer!EnableFileTracing to 1**\n\n    The WDS log will be generated at **%SystemRoot%\\\\tracing\\\\wdsserver.log**.\n\n-   The WinRM log can be found in the Event Viewer under **Applications and Services Logs** -**Microsoft** -**Windows** -**Windows Remote Management**.\n\n-   If results are not copied to the server, you can locate them on the test computer. The log file at %SystemDrive%\\\\relax\\\\&lt;GUID&gt;\\\\job\\\\results.log points to the results folder where the results were saved.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-symbolserver\"></a>Set up a Symbol Server\n\n\nSome assessments require access to symbols. In some cases the information in the assessment results can be incorrect or have missing information if a symbol server is not available. In many cases this dependency is satisfied by Internet connectivity and access to the Microsoft public symbols server. In other cases where connectivity to the Internet is not available such as a lab environment, you can set up a private symbols server or install the symbols on the local computer to get the full benefits of the assessments.\n\n**To set the symbols environment variable on a test computer**\n\n1.  Open File Explorer, right-click **Computer**, and select **Properties**.\n\n2.  In the Properties window click **Advanced System Settings**.\n\n3.  In the Systems Properties window, on the **Advanced** tab, click **Environment Variables**.\n\n4.  Under System variables, click **New** to set the symbols environment variable by using one of the following paths:\n\n    1.  Use the public symbols server (requires Internet connection)\n\n        Connect the computer to the Internet so that it can access the Microsoft symbols server, and then configure the \\_NT\\_SYMBOL\\_PATH environment variable to use the Microsoft symbols server at **http://msdl.microsoft.com/downloads/symbols**.\n\n    2.  Use a network connected symbols path (requires local network connection)\n\n        Connect the computer to the local intranet and then configure the \\_NT\\_SYMBOL\\_PATH environment variable to use an intranet symbols path.\n\n    3.  Use a local symbols path\n\n        Download the symbols to the Windows Assessment Services server computer, and point the test computer to this location by setting the \\_NT\\_SYMBOL\\_PATH environment variable to use a path to the symbols on the server, such as \\\\\\\\WASServer\\\\relax\\\\symbols.\n\n**To set up internal symbols**\n\n1.  Install the ADK, and initialize WAS.\n\n2.  Get an IPsec boundary exception for the WAS server machine. This will ensure that WAS test machines are able to access the Relax share.\n\n3.  Join the WAS server machine to the domain.\n\n4.  Add a domain user to the WAS server machine into the Administrators group that has access to internal symbol server.\n\n5.  Stop the WAS service by running the following command from an elevated command prompt:\n\n    **net stop WASSVC**\n\n6.  Change the service logon account to the new domain account.\n\n7.  Run the following command from an elevated command prompt, replacing &lt;*path to internal symbols*&gt; with the appropriate path:\n\n    **SETX\\_NT\\_SYMBOL\\_PATH \\\\\\\\&lt;path to internal symbols&gt; /M**\n\n8.  Restart the machine.\n\nFor more information about how to set the symbols path and download symbols, see [MSDN: Symbols Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235359). For information about how to troubleshoot missing symbols, see [Common In-Depth Analysis Issues](common-in-depth-analysis-issues.md#missingsymbols).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-unableconnect\"></a>Unable to connect to server\n\n\nIf the Windows Assessment Services - Client (Windows ASC) cannot connect to the server, you might receive the following error message:\n\n*Unable to connect to the remote server: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or an established connection failed because the connected host has failed to respond.*\n\nCheck the server status by using the **sc query wassvc** command.

You cannot service an x86-based image from an x64-based host that does not support WOW64. Try the operation again from a host environment that supports WOW64. \nError running Driver Scavenge. ErrorCode 193.\n```\n\nWhen you inventory a computer, driver information is gathered and stored at **&lt;%systemdrive%\\\\relax\\\\driver** using DISM. DISM cannot run the driver servicing command on an X86 Windows image, from a Windows PE X64 environment. For more information, see DISM Supported Platforms.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nUse (or create) a bootable USB drive created for X86 architecture. For more information, see [Windows Assessment Services Setup and Configuration](windows-assessment-services-setup-and-configuration-wastechref.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-reimagetestcomp\"></a>Test computers must be reimaged if you change the Server name\n\n\nIf you rename the Windows Assessment Services server and re-initialize it, you must redeploy Windows on the test computer before you run additional assessments.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-machinereach\"></a>“Machine not reachable” errors\n\n\nWhen running assessments remotely, Windows Assessment Services relies on DNS to resolve the test computer names. If DNS has duplicate entries for the same computer name, one from a domain joined computer and another from a workgroup computer, Windows and WinRM will pick the computer that DNS resolves to.\n\nIf you receive an error that includes \"Machine Not Reachable\", check the DNS entries for duplicates.\n\n**Note**  \nThe computer name must contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes. If the computer name contains an underscore or other extended characters, the computer may not be discoverable via Domain Name System (DNS).\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-msmq\"></a>Running Windows ASC from a server other than the Windows Assessment Services server\n\n\nIf you are running Windows ASC on a Windows server and you do not have Windows Assessment Services installed on that server, push notifications will fail to enable in Windows ASC when you launch it.\n\n**Workaround**\n\nOn the server where Windows ASC is installed, enable the optional component MSMQ-Server using the following DISM command from an elevated command prompt.\n\n``` syntax\nDism /Online /Enable-Feature:MSMQ-Server\n```\n\nOr run Windows ASC on a client computer, or the same server where Windows Assessment Services is installed.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-ts-dumps\"></a>The dumps folder does not contain any dump files\n\n\nBy default, dump files are not copied to the server after assessment runs.

By default, this value is false.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
