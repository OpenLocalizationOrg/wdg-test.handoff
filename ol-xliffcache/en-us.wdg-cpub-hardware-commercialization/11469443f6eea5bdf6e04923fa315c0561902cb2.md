# How to Recover a Profile


If you make changes to a preset graph, but do not save it as a new preset when you close Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), WPA detects the unsaved changes and saves the work in a recovered profile. When you reopen WPA, you can find the recovered profile.

This helps you recover the information you forgot to save, but also allows you to save the recovered information to a new profile, which you can apply to view the corresponding analysis.

**To recover a profile**

1.  On the **Profiles** menu, click **Apply Recently Used Profile**. A secondary menu opens, featuring the latest profile(s) used.

2.  Click the profile you want to apply. WPA applies the selected profile and opens that profile on a new **Analysis** tab.
