The measurements are obtained from performance traces collected using Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) during a Windows 10 system’s first startup. The assessment measures the duration of First Logon as well as specific aspects such as Active Setup and Provisioned App Install.\n\nThis topic helps you interpret the results produced by the OOBE Performance assessment. It also provides guidance on how to use the results to identify and resolve issues that impact the OOBE experience.\n\n## Metrics\n\n\nThe following metrics are reported by the OOBE Performance assessment.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Metric</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>First Logon Time</p></td>\n<td><p>Measures the time in seconds to logon.

The assessment results for the two configurations can be compared side by side in the Windows Assessment Console (WAC) to identify the metrics with the largest differences. Clicking on the links to the ETW traces displayed in WAC will display the corresponding performance trace in Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). WPA can be used to drill down into the CPU and disk utilization of each configuration and similarly comparing the two configurations side by side will help identify the processes that are showing the largest deltas in their use of the CPU and disk.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Assessments](assessments.md)\n\n[Out of Box Experience](out-of-box-experience.md)\n\n[Windows Assessment Toolkit](index.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
