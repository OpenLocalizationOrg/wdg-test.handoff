operations and capture metrics. This assessment measures durations and throughput while copying, moving, compressing, extracting, and deleting files and folders on your computer. The results help you understand how well the computer performs during these operations. For more information about the results, see [Results for the File Handling Assessment](results-for-the-file-handling-assessment.md).\n\n**Warning**  \nThe File Handling assessment is only supported on English (United States) versions of Windows. Running this assessment on non-English (United States) versions of Windows might prompt you with an error and the assessment might stop running.\n\n \n\nThe following graphic illustrates the assessment process.\n\n![workflow graphic for file handling](images/dep-win8-8-techref-fileorgassessmentflow.jpg)\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [System Requirements](#sysrqmnts)\n\n-   [Workloads](#bkmk-fileworkloads)\n\n-   [Settings](#assesssettings)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"sysrqmnts\"></a>System Requirements\n\n\nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\nRun this assessment only while the desktop is full screen. Do not run this assessment if you have another Windows Store app opened side-by-side with the desktop.\n\nWhen running this assessment on Windows 8.1, make sure the **Collect Analysis Trace** setting is unchecked when assessing expected battery life. When checked, this option will produce an incorrect estimation.\n\nEnable analysis trace collection only when you need additional information to investigate other energy-related problems.\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems. The assessment isn't supported for use on virtual machines.\n\nYou can run this assessment on Windows RT in either of the following ways:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows Assessment Console and then run it on Windows RT. For more information, see [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services to run assessments on Windows RT. For more information, see [Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-fileworkloads\"></a>Workloads\n\n\nA workload is a set of automated tasks that simulate user activity in a predefined, repeatable manner. This assessment measures durations and throughput for the following workloads, and it captures the metrics in the results file.\n\n-   **Programmatic Workloads.** These workloads use the API to perform file functions. These workloads measure only the underlying file functionality. File operations include **copypg**, **movepg**, and **deletepg**.\n\n-   **Scripted Workloads.** These workloads simulate user activity in File Explorer on a computer running Windows 8. File operations include **copyuxxs**, **deleteuxs**, **moveuxs**, and **zipuxs**. Scripted workloads can't be used if you're running the assessment on a computer running Windows 7.\n\nFor more information about choosing a workload, see [Settings](#assesssettings).\n\n**Note**  \nYou can also use the File Handling assessment as a workload in an energy-efficiency job. For more information about energy-efficiency jobs, see [Create and run an energy efficiency job](create-and-run-an-energy-efficiency-job.md).\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"assesssettings\"></a>Settings\n\n\nBy default, this assessment uses the recommended settings.
