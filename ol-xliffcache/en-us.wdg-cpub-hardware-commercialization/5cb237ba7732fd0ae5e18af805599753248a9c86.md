# Service a Windows Image Using DISM


The Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool lets users enumerate drivers and packages, modify configuration settings, add and remove drivers without using an unattended answer file, and more. You can use DISM offline on a WIM or VHD file, or online on a running operating system.

Offline servicing allows you to modify or service a Windows® image entirely offline, without booting it first. This can reduce deployment costs because you can customize images to a degree before the operating system is deployed to the computer. In addition, if you have a stored master image that you want to make sure is always up to date, you can maintain it without booting the image.

You can also use DISM to service an image online. If you have to boot the operating system to install an application or test and validate the installation, you can boot to audit mode and add drivers and packages, or enable features and international settings.
