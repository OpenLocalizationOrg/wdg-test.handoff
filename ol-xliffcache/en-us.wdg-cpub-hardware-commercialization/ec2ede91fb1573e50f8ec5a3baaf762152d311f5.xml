Security Software Impact\n\n\nThe Internet Explorer security software impact assessment measures aspects of Internet Explorer that are typically impacted by antimalware and other browser add-ins. The assessment measures the impact of security software on the display time, CPU time, and resource utilization of Internet Explorer.\n\nFor more information about results and issues produced by this assessment, see [Results for Internet Explorer Security Software Impact Assessment](results-for-internet-explorer-security-software-impact-assessment.md).\n\n## Before You Begin\n\n\nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\nFor best results:\n\n-   Compare results from this assessment to results from the same assessment on the same PC with a clean Windows image with only Windows Defender running. This will help you identify the impact of the antimalware software added to the image.\n\n### System requirements\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows RT\n\n-   Windows 8.1\n\n-   Windows RT 8.1\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems.\n\nYou can run this assessment on a Windows RT 8.1 system in either of the following ways:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows Assessment Console, and then run it on Windows RT 8.1. For more information about this option, see [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services. For more information, see [Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-settings\"></a>Settings\n\n\nYou can use the default settings or customize the settings for an assessment. When you review the results, you can see whether the assessment used the recommended settings or custom settings so that you can compare results from the same jobs across multiple computers or over time.\n\nThe following table describes the assessment settings, recommended values, and alternative values for each setting.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Use recommended settings</p></td>\n<td><p>By default, this check box is selected and recommended settings are used.
