# Providers


Providers are Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) components that expose events to Windows Performance Recorder (WPR). You can use a single system provider and multiple event providers in a profile, including a heap event provider.

## System Providers


A system provider provides kernel events. System providers are defined by using the following:

-   Keywords for the events to be collected.

-   Stacks from which to collect events.

-   Pool tags to indicate the component that made the allocation or the allocation type.

For a description of supported system keywords, see [Keyword (in SystemProvider)](keyword--in-systemprovider-.md).

## Event Providers


You can configure event providers to provide certain types of events (among those that are supported by the provider) by specifying a hexadecimal bitmask keyword. Because providers support different events, there are no string constants for these keywords. Therefore, they must be hexadecimal-style strings.
