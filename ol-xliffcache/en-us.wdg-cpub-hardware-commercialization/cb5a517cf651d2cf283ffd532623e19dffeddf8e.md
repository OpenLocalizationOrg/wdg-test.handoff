# Initialize-FirmwareSubmission cmdlet


Use this standalone cmdlet to prepare a firmware submission. This cmdlet combines the firmware submission into a zip file on the local computer, and does not communicate with partner services.

After using this cmdlet, use [New-FirmwareSubmission cmdlet](new-firmwaresubmission-cmdlet.md) to upload the zip file that contains the firmware submission. This cmdlet provides only a .NET file object as an output. To submit the zip file that is created from this cmdlet, use the **New-FirmwareSubmission** cmdlet.

## <span id="Prerequisites"></span><span id="prerequisites"></span><span id="PREREQUISITES"></span>Prerequisites


Create a package using ImgGen.cmd. This creates multiple files, including an UpdateHistory.xml file and a targeting package file, which is named using the following format where &lt;OEM&gt; is the name of the OEM and &lt;Device&gt; is the name of the device:

&lt;OEM&gt;.&lt;Device&gt;.Customizations.MainOS.spkg

To use the same image for multiple OEMs or devices, add a targeting file (PhoneMetadataDeviceTargetingInfo.xml). For more info, see [DeviceInfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt138322).

A string path to the UpdateHistory file.

<span id="-OemInputPath__required_"></span><span id="-oeminputpath__required_"></span><span id="-OEMINPUTPATH__REQUIRED_"></span>*-OemInputPath (required)*  
A string path to the OEMInput.xml file.

<span id="-TypeOfSubmission__required_"></span><span id="-typeofsubmission__required_"></span><span id="-TYPEOFSUBMISSION__REQUIRED_"></span>*-TypeOfSubmission (required)*  
The submission type. The type must be **Image**, **FfuCatalog**, or **PartialImage**.

<span id="-OutputFilePath__required_"></span><span id="-outputfilepath__required_"></span><span id="-OUTPUTFILEPATH__REQUIRED_"></span>*-OutputFilePath (required)*  
A string path to the resulting output zip file. If this parameter does not contain a full path, the output file is saved in the current working directory.

<span id="-TypeOfProduct"></span><span id="-typeofproduct"></span><span id="-TYPEOFPRODUCT"></span>*-TypeOfProduct*  
An optional parameter that specifies the target product of the firmware submission. The product must be one of WindowsPhoneBlue, WindowsPhoneThreshold and WindowsIoTCoreThreshold. Default is WindowsPhoneBlue.

**Note**  Product values may be added or removed periodically.

 

<span id="-SignedRemovalPackageFolder"></span><span id="-signedremovalpackagefolder"></span><span id="-SIGNEDREMOVALPACKAGEFOLDER"></span>*-SignedRemovalPackageFolder*  
A string path to a folder that contains removal packages (with file extensions ending in .spkr) to be added to an image.

<span id="-PackagesToRemoveFolder"></span><span id="-packagestoremovefolder"></span><span id="-PACKAGESTOREMOVEFOLDER"></span>*-PackagesToRemoveFolder*

<span id="-Baseline"></span><span id="-baseline"></span><span id="-BASELINE"></span>*-Baseline*  
Declare a firmware submission to be a baseline so it can be used for retail servicing (via Request for Update (RFU)). Baseline submissions must be Windows Standard Package Configuration compliant. For more info, see [Windows Standard Packaging Configuration (WSPC) requirements for retail images](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn756781).

This flag cannot be used with **–TypeOfSubmission FfuCatalog** or **–TypeOfSubmission PartialImage**.

Also, this flag cannot be used with **–SignedRemovalPackageFolder** or **–PackagesToRemoveFolder**.

<span id="-NonWspcCompliant"></span><span id="-nonwspccompliant"></span><span id="-NONWSPCCOMPLIANT"></span>*-NonWspcCompliant*  
This parameter is deprecated. It was originally used to indicate that the submission was meant not to be compliant with the Windows Phone Standard Package Configuration (WSPC). The WSPC model has changed and this flag is no longer used.

For more info about WSPC requirements, see [Windows Standard Packaging Configuration (WSPC) requirements for retail images](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn756781).

<span id="-FfuPath"></span><span id="-ffupath"></span><span id="-FFUPATH"></span>*-FfuPath*  
Full path to a FFU file that contains the FFU catalog to be submitted to be signed. Include this parameter when specifying **–TypeOfSubmission FfuCatalog**.

<span id="-PartialImageDirectory"></span><span id="-partialimagedirectory"></span><span id="-PARTIALIMAGEDIRECTORY"></span>*-PartialImageDirectory*  
Full path to a directory that contains a partial image that consists only of SPKG files. Include this parameter when specifying **–TypeOfSubmission PartialImage**.

## <span id="Sample_Windows_PowerShell_scripts"></span><span id="sample_windows_powershell_scripts"></span><span id="SAMPLE_WINDOWS_POWERSHELL_SCRIPTS"></span>Sample Windows PowerShell scripts


The following Windows PowerShell script can be used to submit a FFU catalog to be signed.

``` syntax
Initialize-FirmwareSubmission -TypeOfSubmission FfuCatalog –UpdateHistoryPath [path] –OemInputPath [path] –OutputFilePath [path] –FfuPath [path]
```

The following Windows PowerShell script can be used to submit a partial image to be signed.

``` syntax
Initialize-FirmwareSubmission -TypeOfSubmission PartialImage –UpdateHistoryPath [path] –OemInputPath [path] –OutputFilePath [path] –PartialImageDirectoy [path]
```

The following Windows PowerShell script can be used to read validation errors in the output pipeline of this cmdlet, where \[path\] is replaced with the respective absolute file path.

``` syntax
try 
{
Initialize-FirmwareSubmission -TypeOfSubmission Image –UpdateHistoryPath [path] –OemInputPath [path] –OutputFilePath [path] –SignedRemovalPackageFolder [path] –PackagesToRemoveFolder [path]
}
catch 
{
# Assuming exception is a validation error
Write-Host $_.Exception.ValidationErrorLog
}
```

## <span id="Errors"></span><span id="errors"></span><span id="ERRORS"></span>Errors


If the submission zip isn’t constructed properly, this Windows Powershell cmdlet returns an empty string. If the submission zip is constructed but there were validation errors, these errors are captured in the error log in the submission zip.

In Windows Phone 8.1, a targeting package was required (&lt;OEM&gt;.&lt;Device&gt;.Customizations.MainOS.spkg). If this package isn’t included, an exception will be thrown.
