# High DPI Support for IT Professionals


Windows 8.1 has new features that improve the end user’s experience with premium high density display panels. When using Windows 8.1, activities such as projecting to an external display and desktop scaling on the primary display are significantly improved from previous Windows releases. You will see the most benefit from these features when you are using a dense display, such as a 2560x1440 display with 225 DPI and 200% desktop scaling. This topic explains what is distinctive about these premium display parts, and what Windows 8.1 does to provide better support for them. It also explains some potential issues—including display fuzziness or blurriness—that might impact some users with lower density displays at 125% scaling, and how enterprise IT professionals can address them in Windows 8.1.
