id=\"selectwhichwindowstoinstall\"></span><span id=\"SELECTWHICHWINDOWSTOINSTALL\"></span>Select Which Windows Edition to Install\n\n\nTo select a Windows edition to install, you can do one of the following:\n\n-   Install Windows manually, without an answer file. Windows Setup installs the default edition from the Windows product DVD.\n\n-   Install Windows with an answer file, and include a product key in Microsoft-Windows-Setup\\\\UserData\\\\ProductKey\\\\`Key`. Each product key is specific to a Windows edition. Entering the product key in this setting does not activate Windows.\n\n-   Install Windows with an answer file, and then manually type in a product key during Windows Setup. The product key selects a Windows edition to install.\n\n**Warning**  \nIf you have multiple Windows images with the same Windows edition that are stored in the same Windows image file (.wim), you can use the setting: Microsoft-Windows-Setup\\\\ImageInstall\\\\OSImage\\\\InstallFrom\\\\`MetaData` to differentiate between them. You must still provide a product key using one of the methods listed in the previous list.\n\n \n\nFor information about managing Windows product keys when changing the Windows image to a higher edition, see [Change the Windows Image to a Higher Edition Using DISM](change-the-windows-image-to-a-higher-edition-using-dism.md).\n\n## <span id=\"ActivateWindowsByUsingAProductKey\"></span><span id=\"activatewindowsbyusingaproductkey\"></span><span id=\"ACTIVATEWINDOWSBYUSINGAPRODUCTKEY\"></span>Activate Windows\n\n\nTo automatically activate Windows by using a product key, you can do one of the following:\n\n-   Use the Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup\\\\`ProductKey` unattend setting. You can use either a single-use product key or a Volume License Multiple Activation Key. For more information, see the [Volume Activation Planning Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=734870).\n\n    The product key used to activate Windows must match the Windows edition that you install. If you use a product key to select a Windows edition, we recommend using the same key to activate Windows, so that the edition you install is the same as the edition that you activate.\n\n-   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) can use OEM-specific activation tools.\n\nIf a product key isn’t provided prior to Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE), then OOBE will prompt the end user for a product key. If the end user skips this during OOBE, the user will be reminded later to enter a valid product key.\n\n**Warning**  \nIn most Windows 8 deployment scenarios, you no longer have to use the `SkipRearm` answer file setting to reset the Windows Product Activation clock when you run the **Sysprep** command multiple times on a computer. In Windows 8, the `SkipRearm` setting is used to specify the Windows licensing state. If you specify a retail product key or volume license product key, Windows is automatically activated. You can run the **Sysprep** command up to 8 additional times on a single Windows image. After running Sysprep 8 times on a Windows 8 image, you must recreate your Windows image.
