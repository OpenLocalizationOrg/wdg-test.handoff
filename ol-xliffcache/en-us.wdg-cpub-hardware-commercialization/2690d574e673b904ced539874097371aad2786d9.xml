You can also use the DISM image management command to list the image index numbers or to verify the architecture for the image that you are mounting. After you update the image, you must unmount it and either commit or discard the changes you have made.\n\nYou can use DISM servicing commands to install, uninstall, configure, and update the features and packages in offline Windows® images and offline Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) images.
