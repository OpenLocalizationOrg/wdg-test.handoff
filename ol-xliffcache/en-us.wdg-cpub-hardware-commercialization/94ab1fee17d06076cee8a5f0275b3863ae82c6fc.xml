However, if you develop your own assessments by using the Assessment Platform APIs, you must manually register the assessments so that they appear in the Windows Assessment Console and the Windows Assessment Services - Client (Windows ASC).\n\n**Note**  \nYou can use a set of public APIs to create and extend assessments that are compatible with the Assessment Platform. For more information, see [MSDN: Assessment Execution Engine](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=236367).\n\n \n\nYou can use the following command-line options to register or unregister custom assessments.\n\nTo register an assessment:\n\n**Regasmt***&lt;path\\_of\\_assessment&gt;*\n\nTo unregister an assessment:\n\n**Regasmt/u***&lt;path of assessment&gt;*\n\n**Note**  \n**Regasmt.exe** is installed by default when the Windows Assessment Toolkit is installed.

At an elevated command prompt, type this:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    regasmt C:\\MyAssessments\\example.asmtmanifest.asmtx\n    ```\n\n    Where C:\\\\MyAssessments\\\\example.asmtmanifest is the path of the assessment. Relative paths are supported.\n\n2.  To register more than one assessment, list the assessments. For example:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    regasmt C:\\MyAssessments\\example.asmtmanifest.asmtx example2.asmtmanifest.asmtx\n    ```\n\n**To unregister an assessment**\n\n-   At an elevated command prompt, type this:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    regasmt /u C:\\MyAssessments\\example.asmtmanifest.asmtx\n    ```\n\n    **Note**  \n    Unregistering an assessment does not uninstall it.
