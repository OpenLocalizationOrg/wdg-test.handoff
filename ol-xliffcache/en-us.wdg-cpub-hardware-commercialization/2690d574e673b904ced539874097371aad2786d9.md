# Create and Manage a Windows Image Using DISM


Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe) mounts a Windows image (.wim) file or virtual hard disk (.vhd or .vhdx) for servicing. You can also use the DISM image management command to list the image index numbers or to verify the architecture for the image that you are mounting. After you update the image, you must unmount it and either commit or discard the changes you have made.

You can use DISM servicing commands to install, uninstall, configure, and update the features and packages in offline Windows® images and offline Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) images. For more information about common DISM scenarios, see [What is DISM?](what-is-dism.md). For more information about DISM servicing commands, see [Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Command-Line Options](deployment-image-servicing-and-management--dism--command-line-options.md).
