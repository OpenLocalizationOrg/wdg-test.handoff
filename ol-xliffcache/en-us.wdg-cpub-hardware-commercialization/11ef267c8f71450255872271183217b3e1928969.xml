All IoT Core devices will get updates automatically.\n-   **OEM updates.** These are also referred to as Board Support Package (BSP) updates. OEMs develop specific BSP updates for their devices such as the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Minnowboard Max. These are then published to the Microsoft Update server where specified IoT Core devices can download and receive the OEM updates automatically.\n\nOEM and enterprise customers have the option to manage IoT Core device updates using the Windows 10 IoT Core Pro (IoT Core Pro) SKU. Customers using Windows 10 IoT Core (IoT Core) will automatically receive both OS and OEM updates.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
