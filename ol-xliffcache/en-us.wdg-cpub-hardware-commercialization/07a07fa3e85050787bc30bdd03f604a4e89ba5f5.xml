'PreferredLib:/library/windows/hardware'\ntitle: Enable Remote Desktop by Using an Answer File\n---\n\n# Enable Remote Desktop by Using an Answer File\n\n\nTo enable remote desktop connections during an unattended installation, you must configure several settings and enable the Remote Desktop group in Windows速 Firewall with Advanced Security.\n\n**To create an answer file to enable remote desktop connections**\n\n1.  On your technician computer, open Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM). Click **Start**, type **Windows System Image Manager**, and then select **Windows System Image Manager**.\n\n2.  Create a new answer file, or update an existing answer file. For more information, see [Create or Open an Answer File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915085) and [Best Practices for Authoring Answer Files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915073).\n\n    Add these settings to your answer file in the listed configuration pass:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Component</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Configuration pass</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><strong>4 specialize</strong></p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Networking-MPSSVC-Svc\\FirewallGroups\\FirewallGroup</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><strong>4 specialize</strong></p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n3.  In the **Answer File** pane, configure these settings:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Component</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><code>fDenyTSConnections=false</code></p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Networking-MPSSVC-Svc\\FirewallGroups\\FirewallGroup</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><code>Active=true</code></p>\n    <p><code>Group=Remote Desktop</code></p>\n    <p><code>Profile=all</code></p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n4.  (Optional) Specify how users are authenticated. Specifying the following setting will help make sure that users can connect remotely from computers that don't run Remote Desktop by using network-level authentication. To enable remote desktop connections from computers that are running any version of Remote Desktop, add this setting to your answer file:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Component</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Configuration pass</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDP-WinStationExtensions</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><strong>4 specialize</strong></p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><code>UserAuthentication=0</code></p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\nYou're now ready to install your Windows image.\n\nFor more information about Windows速 components and settings that you can add to an answer file, see the [Unattended Windows Setup Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn923277).\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[Configure Windows Firewall with Advanced Security by Using an Answer File](configure-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-by-using-an-answer-file.md)\n\n[Automate Windows Setup](automate-windows-setup.md)\n\n[Configure Network Settings in an Unattended Installation](configure-network-settings-in-an-unattended-installation.md)\n\n[Windows Deployment Options](windows-deployment-options.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
