You can add or remove language packs or drivers, and you can update an existing offline or online image when new software and hardware become available. Offline servicing is updating an image that has been mounted or applied, but is not currently installed and running. Online servicing is updating the image on a running installation of the Windows operating system. You can use DISM to mount a Windows image (.wim) file or a virtual hard disk (VHD) for servicing.\n\n## <span id=\"In_This_Section\"></span><span id=\"in_this_section\"></span><span id=\"IN_THIS_SECTION\"></span>In This Section\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Use DISM in Windows PowerShell](use-dism-in-windows-powershell-s14.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Import DISM cmdlets into a Windows PowerShell environment.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Install Windows 10 using a previous version of Windows PE](copy-dism-to-another-computer.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Use the Windows 10 version of DISM on a previous version of Windows PE to deploy Windows 10.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Create and Manage a Windows Image Using DISM](create-and-manage-a-windows-image-using-dism.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Capture, mount, or apply a Windows image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Take Inventory of an Image or Component Using DISM](take-inventory-of-an-image-or-component-using-dism.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Get information about an online or offline image and how to get information about the components in an image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Service a Windows Image Using DISM](service-a-windows-image-using-dism.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Modify or service a Windows image by adding or removing drivers, packages, features, language packs, or by changing the Windows image to a higher edition.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Repair a Windows Image](repair-a-windows-image.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Repair a Windows Image if the operating system has become corrupted or the image is unserviceable.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Manage the Component Store](manage-the-component-store.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Get information about the component store (WinSxS folder) and about how to reduce the size of the WinSxS folder.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[What is DISM?](what-is-dism.md)\n\n[DISM Reference (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)](dism-reference--deployment-image-servicing-and-management.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
