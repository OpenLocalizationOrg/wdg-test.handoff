# IoT Core Update


Windows 10 IoT Core (IoT Core) devices will automatically receive OS updates via Windows Update when connected to the internet.

There are two types of updates that IoT Core devices receive:

-   **OS updates.** These OS and security updates target Microsoft code in the image, including the Microsoft packages in the ESP (EFI system partition) and the Main OS partitions, and Microsoft packages for the system loaders. All IoT Core devices will get updates automatically.
-   **OEM updates.** These are also referred to as Board Support Package (BSP) updates. OEMs develop specific BSP updates for their devices such as the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Minnowboard Max. These are then published to the Microsoft Update server where specified IoT Core devices can download and receive the OEM updates automatically.

OEM and enterprise customers have the option to manage IoT Core device updates using the Windows 10 IoT Core Pro (IoT Core Pro) SKU. Customers using Windows 10 IoT Core (IoT Core) will automatically receive both OS and OEM updates.
