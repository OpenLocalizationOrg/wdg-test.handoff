# DISM Reference (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)


Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that is used to service Windows® images offline before deployment. You can use it to install, uninstall, configure, and update Windows features, packages, drivers, and international settings. Subsets of the DISM servicing commands are also available for servicing a running operating system. For more information, see [What is DISM?](what-is-dism.md).
