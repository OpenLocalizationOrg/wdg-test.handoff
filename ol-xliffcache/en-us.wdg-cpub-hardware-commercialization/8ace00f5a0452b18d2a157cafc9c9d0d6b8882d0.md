# Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission cmdlet


The code-signed firmware can be retrieved after a successful submission to Microsoft. If the submission is successful, the OEM receives a ticket number. Use the **Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission** cmdlet to retrieve the signed submission for the code sign ticket number.

The following is the syntax for the **Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission** cmdlet.

``` syntax
NAME
     Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission
SYNTAX
     Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission
      [-TicketId] <string>
      [[-DownloadDirectory] <string>]
      [-ServiceUri <uri>]
      [-CertificateStoreLocation <StoreLocation> {CurrentUser | LocalMachine}]
      [-CertificateStoreName <StoreName> {AddressBook | AuthRoot | CertificateAuthority
         | Disallowed | My | Root | TrustedPeople | TrustedPublisher}]
      [-ClientCertificateThumbprint <string>]
      [-EncryptionCertificateThumbprint <string>]
      [<CommonParameters>]
```

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


Typically, the only parameters that are specified for this cmdlet are **TicketId** and **DownloadDirectory**.

The cmdlet obtains the default values for the rest of the parameters from a configuration file. By default, this configuration file is placed by the installer at: %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft\\WP Ingestion Client\\Modules\\Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.Client\\ Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.Client.dll.config

An example config file is provided in the Config file section of this document.

If any of the non-required parameters are explicitly specified on the command line, those values override the default values that are stored in the configuration file.

To support Windows PowerShell automation scripts, the cmdlet returns an object of type `Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.SignedFirmwareSubmission`:

``` syntax
TypeName: Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.SignedFirmwareSubmission

Name        MemberType Definition
----        ---------- ----------
Equals      Method     bool Equals(System.Object obj)
GetHashCode Method     int GetHashCode()
GetType     Method     type GetType()
ToString    Method     string ToString()
File        Property   System.IO.FileInfo File {get;set;}
FirmwareSubmissionTicketId    Property   string TicketId {get;set;}
```

This object can be processed using Windows PowerShell or displayed on the command line. The following sections show common usage scenarios and common error cases for retrieving signed submissions.

**Note**  
Many of these commands are shown here as multiple lines, but must be entered as a single line in Windows PowerShell.

-   The ticket ID is not defined in the service.

-   The authenticated user is not the owner of the firmware submission.

-   The ticket ID is a resubmission ticket.

-   Code signing is still in progress.

-   Code signing is pending manual intervention from Microsoft. No OEM action required.

-   Code signing has failed.

Retrieve the signed submission for a ticket and store the result object in a Windows PowerShell variable:

``` syntax
PS> $result = Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission –FirmwareSubmissionTicketId TKT-SIGN-TEST-BTUADL 
-DownloadDirectory C:\temp
```

Show the result on the console:

``` syntax

valid for the current state of service.
Details: Unable to retrieve the specified firmware submission. Reason: Code signing is still in progress.
Reason: FirmwareSubmissionIsInProgress.

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.Exceptions.FirmwareSubmissionInProgressException,Microso
   ft.Phone.PartnerServices.Cmdlets.GetSignedFirmwareSubmissionCommand            
```

This state is indicated by the returned reason, “Code signing is still in progress”.

If a custom PowerShell script is being used, it can be programmed to catch an exception (Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.Exceptions.FirmwareSubmissionInProgressException). That exception can be examined to determine if the submission has completed. The following code sample illustrates how to extract the error information from the returned result object.

``` syntax
      $result = ''
        try {
            $result = Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission -FirmwareSubmissionTicketId "TKT-SIGN-TEST-17Y8M5" -DownloadDirectory c:\MyFirmwareSubmissions
        }
        catch [Microsoft.Phone.PartnerServices.Exceptions.FirmwareSubmissionInProgressException] {
            write-host "Error Message" + $_.Exception.Message
            write-host "Error Detail" + $_.Exception.Detail
            
            #exit or take other action since we've detected a failure
            exit 1
        } 
```

A loop can be constructed to wait (for at least 30 minutes) and then try again to determine if the submission has completed. You are strongly advised that such a polling style must not be invoked with intervals of less than 30 minutes to avoid overwhelming the update server.
