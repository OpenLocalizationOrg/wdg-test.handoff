# Xperf Profile Overview


A trace profile is a collection of settings about a specific type of trace. These profiles are not compatible for recording with Windows Performance Recorder (WPR). You can gather and control these settings with a single command per operation. Most profiles are one of these two types: memory-based or file-based. Select the profile that matches the mechanism that you use for tracing: writing to a buffer in memory or writing to a file.

The following table describes the types of sessions.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Session Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>InSequentialFile sessions</p></td>
<td><p>These sessions are saved into a file sequentially, extending it until a preset maximum file size is reached. This behavior maps to the ETW sequential mode.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>InBuffer sessions</p></td>
<td><p>These sessions save data in memory, overwriting the oldest data with the most recent data when the buffer is full. These sessions must be saved to a snapshot file for analysis. This behavior maps to the ETW buffering mode.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

**Note**  
The file modes cannot be combined.
