format hard drives by using an MBR file system. Windows does not support the GUID partition table (GPT) file system on BIOS-based computers.\n\nAn MBR drive can have up to four standard partitions. Typically, these standard partitions are designated as *primary partitions*. For information about how to create additional partitions beyond this limit, see [Configure More than Four Partitions on a BIOS/MBR-Based Hard Disk](configure-more-than-four-partitions-on-a-biosmbr-based-hard-disk.md).\n\n**Windows partition requirements:**\n\n-   **System partition**\n\n    Each bootable drive must contain a system partition.
