To understand the fundamentals of how resetting the device alters the operating system, carefully review [Resetting the device](../../manufacture/mobile/resetting-a-phone-during-manufacturing.md).\n\n## <span id=\"OS_and_BSP_updates\"></span><span id=\"os_and_bsp_updates\"></span><span id=\"OS_AND_BSP_UPDATES\"></span>OS and BSP updates\n\n\nMicrosoft OS and OEM Board Support Package (BSP) updates—and any associated registry changes—persist after the device is reset. For the user, this means that updates do not need to be downloaded when the device is reset. For the OEM, this means that newer versions of the OS and BSP updates need to be designed to allow compatibility with older apps, whose updates reverted when the device is reset.\n\n## <span id=\"Preloaded_apps\"></span><span id=\"preloaded_apps\"></span><span id=\"PRELOADED_APPS\"></span>Preloaded apps\n\n\nWhen the device is reset, preloaded apps install from the current version of the XAP that is stored on the phone. The current version is either the original XAP that shipped on the device or the most recent version that was received in an OEM over-the-air (OTA) update. The user may still need to download updates to the apps, if later versions have been published to the Store but have not been delivered as part of an OTA update.\n\nThere are additional important considerations for updating preloaded system setting apps.
