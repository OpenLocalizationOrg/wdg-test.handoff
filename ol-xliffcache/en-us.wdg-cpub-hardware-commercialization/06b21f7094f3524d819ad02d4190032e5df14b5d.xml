Clicking on the links to the ETW traces displayed in WAC will display the corresponding performance trace in Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). WPA can be used to drill down into the CPU and disk utilization of each configuration and similarly comparing the two configurations side by side will help identify the processes that are showing the largest deltas in their use of the CPU and disk.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Edge Security Software Impact](edge-security-software-impact.md)\n\n[Windows Assessment Toolkit Technical Reference](windows-assessment-toolkit-technical-reference.md)\n\n[Assessments](assessments.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
