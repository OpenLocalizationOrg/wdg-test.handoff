The focus of this assessment is on the quality and performance of steady-state playback in Windows Media Player, which mimics the workload of a user watching a movie. The results produced by this assessment can help you assess media playing capabilities and performance and quality issues. This assessment does not evaluate any seeking or pausing functionality.
