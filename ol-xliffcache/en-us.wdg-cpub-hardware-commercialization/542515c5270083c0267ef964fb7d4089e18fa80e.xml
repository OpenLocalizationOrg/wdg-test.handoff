These profiles are not compatible for recording with Windows Performance Recorder (WPR). You can gather and control these settings with a single command per operation. Most profiles are one of these two types: memory-based or file-based. Select the profile that matches the mechanism that you use for tracing: writing to a buffer in memory or writing to a file.\n\nThe following table describes the types of sessions.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Session Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>InSequentialFile sessions</p></td>\n<td><p>These sessions are saved into a file sequentially, extending it until a preset maximum file size is reached.
