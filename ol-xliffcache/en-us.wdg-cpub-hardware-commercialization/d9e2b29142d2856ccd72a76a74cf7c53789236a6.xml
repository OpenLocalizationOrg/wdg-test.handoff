This topic describes the Boot Performance (Fast Startup), Hibernate Performance, and Standby Performance assessments.\n\nThis graphic illustrates the assessment process:\n\n![workflow graphic for on/off transition performance](images/dep-win8-8-techref-on-off-combined.jpg)\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [About On/Off Transition Performance Assessments](#bkmk-aboutonoff)\n\n-   [Before You Begin](#beforeyoubegin)\n\n-   [Settings](#settings)\n\n-   [Results](#results)\n\n-   [Issues](#bkmk-issues)\n\nFor more information about how to analyze results for the Boot (Fast Startup) assessment, see [Results for the On/Off Assessments](results-for-the-onoff-assessments.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-aboutonoff\"></a>About On/Off Transition Performance Assessments\n\n\nEach On/Off Transition Performance assessment evaluates one of these transitions:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Transition</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Boot (fast startup)</p></td>\n<td><p>The Boot Performance (Fast Startup) assessment measures the performance of a new fast-startup transition. Windows 8introduces a boot process that enables faster startup of your computer under most conditions.

When you press the power button, the computer will turn on and Windows will start by using the fast startup process.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<strong>Note</strong>  \n<p>If fast startup is turned off in <strong>Power Options</strong>, both shutdown and restart occur as full reboots.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n \n</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>Standby</p></td>\n<td><p>The Standby Performance assessment helps you identify the components that have the most impact on the transition between the system states of on and suspend. Suspend is the sleep state in which the computer enters a low-power state (S3) and consumes a very low amount of power. Standby is the act of entering the suspend state. The transition from standby-sleep back to standby-resume is the interval between the time when the computer initiates wake-up and the time when the computer becomes usable and responsive. This is the time after the user presses the power button or a USB device button (if the computer is configured for wake-on-USB), which is sometime after the desktop appears.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Hibernate</p></td>\n<td><p>The Hibernate Performance assessment helps you identify the components that have the most impact on the transition between the system states of hibernate and resume. Hibernate is the sleep state in which system and user data is written to disk in a hiberfile. Then, the system enters the lowest sleep state (S4), and the power is cut. The transition from hibernate back to wake-up from hibernate is the interval between the time when the user initiates wake-up from hibernate (by pressing the power button or a USB device button if the computer is configured for wake-on-USB) and the time when the computer becomes usable and responsive (sometime after the desktop appears).</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<strong>Note</strong>  \n<p>A hiberfile (Hiberfil.sys) is a file that the operating system creates when the computer enters hibernate mode.

The shutdown process now includes writing data to disk in a way that resembles how the hibernate state works. A key difference between the shutdown and reboot of Windows 8 and the shutdown and reboot of previous Windows versions is that all user sessions are logged off normally and the remaining information is written to a hiberfile. Logon remains the same as it was in the previous Windows versions. The new boot process in Windows 8 is usually much faster, as shown here:\n\n![comparison of windows 8 to previous boot process](images/dep-win8-8-techref-comparebootperf(windevprev).jpg)\nThe traditional Windows boot process loads the operating system's kernel, device drivers, and other system component files into memory and loads the logon screen and desktop. Fast startup provides performance benefits by avoiding some of the work that's traditionally required at boot time. The benefits of this new shutdown/boot transition are immediately noticeable.\n\nThere are still several areas where device drivers, services, applications, and other features can adversely affect this scenario. The Boot Performance (Fast Startup) assessment enables you to measure the time of each phase in the scenario, provides insight into what is being run during each subphase, identifies potential issues, and provides remediation guidance for ecosystem partners to improve their products.\n\n**Note**  \nThe traditional Windows boot is still sometimes required on a computer that's running Windows 8. You can initiate it by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete, choosing the power icon, and then choosing **Restart**. When the computer reboots, it uses the traditional boot process.\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"beforeyoubegin\"></a>Before You Begin\n\n\nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\nTo obtain the most accurate and reproducible results from these assessments, set up and prepare the system by performing these actions:\n\n**Note**  \nBefore the On/Off Transition Performance assessments run, they verify that the supported sleep states are available. If a precheck confirms that a required sleep state is not enabled, the assessments won't run.\n\n \n\n-   Because these assessments perform several reboots, we recommend that you set up your system to automate the logon process. To do this, see [Automate reboots before you run an assessment](automate-reboots-before-you-run-an-assessment.md).\n\n    **Warning**  \n    Don't interact with your computer while the assessment is running. This might adversely affect the results. Automating the logon process can help prevent unwanted interaction.\n\n     \n\n-   Make sure that all device drivers are correctly installed. Results may vary significantly if your computer has missing or incorrect drivers. You can use the [Driver Verification](driver-verification.md) assessment to identify driver issues on the computer that you want to assess.\n\n-   Verify that the correct video card and driver are installed. If you have only the MicrosoftÂ® Basic Display Adapter installed, the Standby Performance assessment can't run.\n\n-   Determine whether your system BIOS has been configured to boot from the network, have a CD/DVD inserted into optical drive, BitLocker enabled, or have a multi-boot scenario. These configurations can cause delays in the boot path, and are likely to adversely affect your results.\n\n-   If your system has a multi-boot configuration, a menu for selecting an operating system will appear at startup. The presence of this menu will affect the job results.\n\n### System requirements\n\nYou can run the assessments on these operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based and x64-based systems.\n\n## Settings\n\n\nBy default, these assessments use the recommended settings. Microsoft defines these settings so that you can compare the results across multiple computer configurations or over time on the same computer. When you review the results, the run information includes metadata that indicates whether the assessment used the recommended settings.\n\nYou can also customize the settings for an assessment, if you want to gather data that's different from the default data. For example, you might identify specific data that would help you perform a detailed analysis of a particular aspect of the computer.\n\nThe following table describes the assessment settings that are available for these assessments, in addition to recommended values, and alternative values for each setting.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Use recommended settings</p></td>\n<td><p>Specifies whether the assessment runs by using the default values.

Some of the metrics have additional information that you can view by expanding them.\n\nThe On/Off Transition assessments perform a series of on/off transitions while the assessment is running. A single series of transitions performed by an assessment is referred to as an iteration. There are three different types of iterations: Timing, Analysis, and I/O Analysis.\n\n-   **Timing iterations.** These iterations serve as a basis for the metric values for all shutdown and boot metrics that are captured. Each On/Off transition assessment performs three timing iterations by default and collects three Timing ETL traces. The metric values presented are the average values between all timing iterations. To see the values for individual iterations, in the Results View, right-click the results column header and then choose **Show iterations**.\n\n-   **Analysis iteration.** This iteration collects information while the assessment is running and serves as basis for issues generated by the assessments. Because of the additional tracing overhead, the operations in this iteration can take longer than in a general use case. Keep this discrepancy (metrics arising from the timing iterations and issues arising from the analysis iteration) in mind when triaging and analyzing assessment results.\n\n-   **I/O Analysis Iteration.** This iteration collects a trace with very detailed information about the I/O subsystem and registry accesses. This trace type is not collected by default, to enable it select the **Collect I/O trace file** assessment settings before running the assessment. The assessments perform 3 reboots by default to capture the actual timing duration for each iteration of the shutdown and boot process.\n\nThis table provides a brief description of the metrics that the On/Off Transition Performance assessments capture:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Metric</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Assessment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Bios Initialization Duration</p></td>\n<td><p>The time, in seconds, to initialize the BIOS, including the Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE).</p></td>\n<td><p>Boot Performance, Standby Performance, Hibernate Performance</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>Explorer Initialization Duration</p></td>\n<td><p>The time to initialize Internet Explorer.
