Use the /Source argument to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature. The source of the files can by the Windows folder in a mounted image, for example c:\\test\\mount\\Windows. You can also use a Windows side-by-side folder as the source of the files, for example z:\\sources\\SxS.\n\nIf you specify multiple /Source arguments, the files are gathered from the first location where they are found and the rest of the locations are ignored.

Beginning with Windows 10, Version 1607, you can specify /Defer with /ResetBase. But we highly recommend you **only** use /Defer as an option in the factory where DISM /Resetbase requires more than 30 minutes to complete. /StartComponentCleanup can be used with Windows 10, Windows 8.x, and Windows PE images above 4.0. /CheckHealth, /ScanHealth, /RestoreHealth, /Source, and /LimitAccess can be used with Windows 10, Windows 8.x, and Windows PE images above 4.0. /HideSP and /SPSuperseded can’t be used when servicing a version of Windows that is earlier than Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) image.\n\n**Tip**  \nTo determine when the /ResetBase option was last run, check the LastResetBase_UTC registry entry under this registry path:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Component Based Servicing\n\nSyntax:\n\n``` syntax\n/Cleanup-Image {/RevertPendingActions | /SPSuperseded [/HideSP] | /StartComponentCleanup [/ResetBase [/Defer]] | /AnalyzeComponentStore | /CheckHealth | /ScanHealth | /RestoreHealth [/Source: <filepath>] [/LimitAccess]}\n```\n\n|   Parameter     |   Description     |\n|-----------------|-------------------|\n| /RevertPendingActions | If you experience a boot failure, you can use the /RevertPendingActions option to try to recover the system. The operation reverts all pending actions from the previous servicing operations because these actions might be the cause of the boot failure. The /RevertPendingActions option is not supported on a running operating system or a Windows PE or Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) image. Important: You should use the /RevertPendingActions option only in a system-recovery scenario on a Windows image that did not boot.|\n| SPSuperseded | Removes any backup files created during the installation of a service pack. Use /HideSP to prevent the service pack from being listed in the Installed Updates Control Panel. The service pack cannot be uninstalled after the /SPSuperseded operation is completed. |\n| /StartComponentCleanup | Cleans up the superseded components and reduces the size of the component store. Use /ResetBase to reset the base of superseded components, which can further reduce the component store size. Installed Windows updates can’t be uninstalled after running /StartComponentCleanup with the /ResetBase option. Use /Defer with /ResetBase to defer long-running cleanup operations to the next automatic maintenance.|\n| /AnalyzeComponentStore | Creates a report of the component store. For more information about the report and how to use the information provided in the report, see [Determine the Actual Size of the WinSxS Folder](determine-the-actual-size-of-the-winsxs-folder.md). |\n| /CheckHealth | Checks whether the image has been flagged as corrupted by a failed process and whether the corruption can be repaired. |\n| /ScanHealth | Scans the image for component store corruption. This operation will take several minutes.  |\n| /RestoreHealth | Scans the image for component store corruption, and then performs repair operations automatically. This operation will take several minutes. |\n| /Source | Used with /RestoreHealth to specify the location of known good versions of files that can be used for the repair, such as a path to the Windows directory of a mounted image.|\n| /LimitAccess | Prevents DISM from contacting Windows Update for repair of online images. | \n\nExamples:\n\n``` syntax\nDism /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Cleanup-Image /RevertPendingActions\n```\n\n``` syntax\nDism /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded /HideSP\n```\n\n``` syntax\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth\n```\n\n``` syntax\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:c:\\test\\mount\\windows /LimitAccess\n```\n\nTo learn more, see [Repair a Windows Image](repair-a-windows-image.md).\n\n## <span id=\"Limitations\"></span><span id=\"limitations\"></span><span id=\"LIMITATIONS\"></span>Limitations\n\n\n-   When you are installing a package in an offline image, the package state is “install pending” because of pending online actions. In other words, the package will be installed when the image is booted and the online actions are processed. If subsequent actions are requested, they cannot be processed until the previous pending online action is completed. You can use the /PreventPending option when you add a package with /AddPackage to skip the installation of a package when there are pending online actions.\n-   Some packages require other packages to be installed first. You should not assume that dependencies will be satisfied. If there are dependency requirements, you should use an answer file to install the necessary packages. By passing an answer file to DISM, multiple packages can be installed in the correct order. This is the preferred method for installing multiple packages. For more information, see [Add or Remove Packages Offline Using DISM](add-or-remove-packages-offline-using-dism.md).\n-   Packages are installed in the order that they are listed in the command line.\n-   When using DISM to list the optional components in a Windows PE image, the optional components will always be listed as pending even when the servicing operation was successful. This is by design and requires no additional action from you.\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[What is DISM?](what-is-dism.md)\n\n[DISM Image Management Command-Line Options](dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14.md)\n\n[Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Command-Line Options](deployment-image-servicing-and-management--dism--command-line-options.md)\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
