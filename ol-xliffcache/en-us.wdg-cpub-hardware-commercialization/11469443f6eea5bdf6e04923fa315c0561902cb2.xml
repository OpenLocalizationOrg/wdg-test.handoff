When you reopen WPA, you can find the recovered profile.\n\nThis helps you recover the information you forgot to save, but also allows you to save the recovered information to a new profile, which you can apply to view the corresponding analysis.\n\n**To recover a profile**\n\n1.  On the **Profiles** menu, click **Apply Recently Used Profile**. A secondary menu opens, featuring the latest profile(s) used.\n\n2.  Click the profile you want to apply. WPA applies the selected profile and opens that profile on a new **Analysis** tab.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Save a Preset](how-to-save-a-preset.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
