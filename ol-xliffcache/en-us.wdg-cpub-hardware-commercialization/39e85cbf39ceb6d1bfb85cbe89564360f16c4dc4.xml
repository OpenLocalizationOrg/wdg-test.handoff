Other network traffic, such as store updates or updates for devices using Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) are not zero-rated.\n\n## <span id=\"Enabling_zero-rating\"></span><span id=\"enabling_zero-rating\"></span><span id=\"ENABLING_ZERO-RATING\"></span>Enabling zero-rating\n\n\nAdd the following two URLs to your network as zero-rated sites:\n\n-   http://wp.download.windowsupdate.com\n\n-   http://wp.ds.download.windowsupdate.com\n\nOnce those URLs are zero-rated, there are no more actions to take to get zero rating in place.

For example, an MO may limit zero-rating downloads to 100MB or less.\n\n1.  Start with a retail device that's ready for an update.\n\n2.  Remove the SIM card (if it has one). Check how much data usage it has associated with it for the current period. Consult with the MO for specific instructions.\n\n3.  Disable all Wi-Fi options:\n\n    1.  In Settings: **Wi-Fi**:\n\n        Change **Wi-Fi networking** to **Off**.\n\n        Change **Turn Wi-Fi back on** to **Manually**.\n\n        Tap Wi-Fi sense, and change **Connect to Wi-Fi hotspots** to **Off**.\n\n    2.  In **Settings** &gt; **Update & recovery** &gt; **Phone update**, clear the **Automatically download updates if my data settings allow it** checkbox.\n\n4.  Force the update through the cellular connection:\n\n    1.  Allow the device to boot up.\n\n    2.  Turn off the device, and then insert a SIM card associated with a data plan.\n\n    3.  Connect the device to power again, boot it up and sign in with your account.\n\n    4.  Search for the update: **Settings** &gt; **Update & recovery** &gt; **Phone update**.
