Partitions on a BIOS/MBR-Based Hard Disk\n\n\nThis topic describes how to configure more than four disk partitions when you deploy Windows on BIOS and master boot record (MBR)-based devices.\n\n## <span id=\"DiskPartitionRules\"></span><span id=\"diskpartitionrules\"></span><span id=\"DISKPARTITIONRULES\"></span>Disk partition rules\n\n\n-   On BIOS-based systems, you can designate one of the four standard partitions as an *extended partition*.\n\n    An extended partition is a special partition that can be divided into additional partitions that are called *logical partitions*. An extended partition cannot store files. An extended partition does not receive a partition ID.\n\n-   You can include as many logical partitions as your disk can hold.\n\n    Logical partitions can store files. You can use a logical partition as the Windows partition.\n\nFor additional disk partition rules for BIOS-based systems, see [Configure BIOS/MBR-Based Hard Drive Partitions](configure-biosmbr-based-hard-drive-partitions.md).\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  Add system and utility partitions before you add the Windows partition.\n\n2.  Add the recovery tools partition immediately after the Windows partition. When you use this partition order, then when future updates to the recovery tools are needed, the partition can be resized automatically.\n\n**Sample partition layout:**\n\n![](images/dep-win10-partitions-bios-morethanfour.png)\n\n## <span id=\"ConfiguringPartitionsUsingDiskPart\"></span><span id=\"configuringpartitionsusingdiskpart\"></span><span id=\"CONFIGURINGPARTITIONSUSINGDISKPART\"></span>Configuring disk partitions by using a DiskPart script in Windows PE\n\n\nFor image-based deployment, boot the device by using Windows PE, and then use the DiskPart tool to create the partition structures on your destination devices. For more information, see [Apply Images Using DISM](apply-images-using-dism.md).\n\n**Note**  \nWindows PE reassigns disk letters alphabetically, beginning with the letter \"C\", without regard to the configuration in Windows Setup. This configuration can change based on the presence of different drives, including USB flash drives.\n\nIn these DiskPart examples, the partitions are assigned the letters \"U\", \"V\", \"S\", \"W\", and \"R\" to avoid drive-letter conflicts. After the device reboots, Windows PE automatically assigns the letter \"C\" to the Windows partition. The Utility1, Utility2, system, and recovery image partitions do not receive drive letters.\n\n \n\nThe following steps describe how to partition your hard drives and prepare to apply images. You can use the code in the sections that follow to complete these steps.\n\n**To partition hard drives and prepare to apply images**\n\n1.  Save the code in the following sections as a text file (PrepareMyPartitions.txt) on a USB flash drive.\n\n2.  Use Windows PE to boot the destination device.\n\n3.  Use the `DiskPart /s F:\\PrepareMyPartitions.txt` command, where *F*: is the letter of the USB flash drive, to partition the drives.\n\n## <span id=\"Sample_code\"></span><span id=\"sample_code\"></span><span id=\"SAMPLE_CODE\"></span>Sample code\n\n\nSave the following code as \"PrepareMyPartitions.txt\", and then run the script by using the DiskPart tool to automate the configuration of the Utility1, Utility2, system, extended, Windows, and recovery tools partitions:\n\n``` syntax\nselect disk 0\nclean\nrem == 1.
