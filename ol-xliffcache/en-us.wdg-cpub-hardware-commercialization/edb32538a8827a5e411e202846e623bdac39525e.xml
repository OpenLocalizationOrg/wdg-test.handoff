The folder contains AxeLog.etl trace files that you can open in Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). The folder also contains ErrorWarnings.xml files and AXELog.txt files. The text file is a compilation of all of the Event Trace Log (ETL) files that are produced after the job finishes.\n\n## The Assessment fails to complete\n\n\nThe job completes, but the assessment doesn't run. One of the following error codes might be reported by the assessment:\n\n-   0x80050006\n\n-   0x80004005\n\nThis error occurs when maintenance tasks have been registered on the PC but have not completed before the assessment run. This prevents the assessment from running, as maintenance tasks often impact assessment metrics.\n\nTo resolve this issue, do one of the following:\n\n1.  Ensure that the computer is connected to a network and is running on AC power. Manually initiate pending maintenance tasks with the following command from an elevated prompt:\n\n    **rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks**\n\n2.  Disable regular and idle maintenance tasks, and stop all maintenance tasks before running the assessment\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Windows Assessment Toolkit](windows-assessment-toolkit-technical-reference.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
