# Test an update


Update testing should begin when your first image is being developed.  Test that your drivers, preloaded apps, and other content can be updated throughout the process.

During the phase when you are building test images, you should perform local testing of updates, run the compatibility tests before and after the update, and look for the same results.  This is a time when you can more easily test a full breadth of phone features with automation and discover update issues early.  Do not wait until you are nearing manufacturing and retail device testing.

Over the Air (OTA) updates can only be tested on retail device, which is more difficult to do because of the higher security on a retail device.  Therefore, it is important that you perform deep functional testing on the test images, and focus your testing on retail phones to ensure that the OTA update is successful by following the guidance in the Network testing of updates section.

OEMs must ensure the quality of an OEM update by fully testing the update before submitting it to Microsoft. As a minimum, the OEM must do the following.

-   Verify that the packages that are updated do not contain any test certificates when testing a retail image.

-   Verify that the firmware revision numbers have changed properly by navigating to **Settings** &gt; **System** &gt; **about** on the device. For more info about versioning information, see [Update requirements](update-requirements.md).

-   Verify that the OEM update package works as designed.

-   Test the update on device that have user data to make sure that their data is preserved. The following are some examples of tests that you can perform to ensure that user data has not been modified after an update.

    -   All user settings are the same.

    -   Start screen tiles have the same position and size.

    -   User data is still on the device (pictures, apps, SMS history, music files, video files, etc.)

Before you submit the update, test it locally. On a PC that you will use during the tests, perform the following steps:

1.  Deploy the updated test packages to the device. You can receive the update packages from the update that has already been approved for testing by using the [Get-SignedFirmwareSubmission cmdlet](get-signedfirmwaresubmission-cmdlet.md).

2.  Verify that the update was successful and that it had no unintentional effects on the behavior of the device.

To prepare to receive an update from the Microsoft test update server, complete the following steps.

1.  Obtain a test update provisioning package from Microsoft after you have signed up to submit requests for firmware and update submissions.

2.  Apply the provisioning package to the device by using IUTool.exe.

3.  Establish a connection to a cellular or Wi-Fi network with the device and attach the device to a charger.

    **Note**  
    We recommend using Wi-Fi to download the update so that you do not run into any constraints with your mobile operator when testing. Mobile operators can specify update download size limits when using their cellular data connection.

     

4.  Initiate the update process via **Settings** &gt; **Update & recovery** &gt; **Phone update**.

5.  When the updates are presented, follow the prompts and complete the update process.

6.  Verify that the update was successful and that it had no unintentional effects on the behavior of the device.
