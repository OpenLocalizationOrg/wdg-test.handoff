(Example, 1.0.0.0 --> 1.0.1.0.)\n\nIf you're adding the image to a retail build or to the Windows Store, sign the app package.\n\n### <span id=\"Apply_update_directly_to_the_device\"></span><span id=\"apply_update_directly_to_the_device\"></span><span id=\"APPLY_UPDATE_DIRECTLY_TO_THE_DEVICE\"></span>Apply update directly to the device\n\nLog into the device and run ApplyUpdate.exe to trigger the update process.\n\n1.  Copy the .cab file to the device. You can do this using an FTP tool such as [WinSCP](http://winscp.net), or by copying the file directly to the device's drive (such as a micro SD card.)\n\n2.  On your technician PC, connect to your device using an SSH client, such as [PuTTY](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe). For example, use the IP address and port 22 to connect to the device, then log in using the Administrator account and password. (To learn more, see [Using SSH to connect and configure a device running Windows IoT Core](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/SSH.md).)\n\n3.  From the device command line, stage the update. You can repeat this step to stage multiple updates.\n    ``` syntax\n    ApplyUpdate.exe -stage <DownloadedPackageName.cab>\n    ```\n\n4.  Commit the changes. This command also triggers the Windows Update process, installing any applicable updates. \n    ``` syntax\n    ApplyUpdate.exe -commit\n    ```\n    \n    (To reject all updates, use: `ApplyUpdate.exe -clear` instead.)\n    \n    Troubleshooting:\n    -  **Error: A certificate chain could not be built to a trusted root authority. (0x800B010A). Signature verification failed.** \n       Possible cause: Adding test signed images to a retail image. Sign the image and try again.\n       \n    -  **Error: 0x80188302.**\n       Possible cause: Package version incorrect. Make sure the new version number is higher than the old version and try again. \n    \n    -  **Error: Could not start update (0x8024A10F)**\n       Possible cause: Windows Update is in progress. Try again after the current Windows Update is completed.\n       \n\n### <span id=\"Apply_update_from_the_Windows_Store\"></span><span id=\"apply_update_from_the_windows_store\"></span><span id=\"APPLY_UPDATE_FROM_THE_WINDOWS_STORE\"></span>Apply update from the Windows Store\n\nSubmit your updated signed package to the Windows Store. When your devices are connected to the internet, they'll periodically check for updates from the Windows Store, and install the updates automatically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
