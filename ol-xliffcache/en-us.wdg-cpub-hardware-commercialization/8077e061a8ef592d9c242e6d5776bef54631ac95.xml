the correct set of drivers. The results include recommendations to help you resolve any issues that the assessment finds. These issues may include missing, duplicate, older, or unnecessary drivers. For more information about results and issues, see [Results for the Driver Verification Assessment](results-for-the-driver-verification-assessment.md).\n\nThe Driver Verification assessment can be used to:\n\n-   Find device and driver issues without using Device Manager.\n\n-   Find missing device drivers in either a Windows image or a running operating system.\n\n-   Find driver issues before you deploy an image to a computer.\n\n-   Find software drivers that are not associated with any hardware devices.\n\nThe following graphic illustrates the assessment process.\n\n![workflow graphic for driver verification](images/dep-win8-8-techref-driverassessmentflow.jpg)\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [System Requirements](#beforebegin)\n\n-   [Settings](#settings)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"beforebegin\"></a>System requirements\n\n\nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems.\n\nThere are two ways to run this assessment on Windows RT:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows Assessment Console and then run it on Windows RT. For additional information about this option, see [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services to run assessments on Windows RT. For more information, see [Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md).\n\n## Settings\n\n\nBy default, this assessment uses the recommended settings. Microsoft defines these settings so that you can compare the results across multiple computer configurations or over time on the same computer. When you review the results, the run information includes metadata that indicates whether the assessment used the recommended settings.\n\nYou can also customize the settings if you want to gather data that's different from what the assessment captures by default. For example, you might identify specific data that can help you perform a detailed analysis of a particular aspect of the computer.\n\nThe following table describes the assessment settings, recommended setting values, and alternative values for each setting.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Use recommended settings</p></td>\n<td><p>Specifies whether the assessment uses the recommended settings.
