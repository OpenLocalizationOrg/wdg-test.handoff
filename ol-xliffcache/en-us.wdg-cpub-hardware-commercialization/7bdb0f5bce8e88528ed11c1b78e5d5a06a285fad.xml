.NET Framework 3.5 by using Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)\n\n\nYou can use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command-line tool to create a modified image to deploy .NET Framework 3.5.\n\n**Important**  \nFor images that will support more than one language, you must add .NET Framework 3.5 binaries before adding any language packs. This order ensures that .NET Framework 3.5 language resources are installed correctly in the reference image and available to users and applications.\n\n \n\n**In this topic:**\n\n-   [Using DISM with Internet connectivity](#internet)\n\n-   [Using DISM with no Internet connectivity](#nointerent)\n\n## <span id=\"internet\"></span><span id=\"INTERNET\"></span>Using DISM with Internet connectivity\n\n\n### <span id=\"Requirements\"></span><span id=\"requirements\"></span><span id=\"REQUIREMENTS\"></span>Requirements\n\n-   Internet connection\n\n-   Access to Windows Update.

Open a command prompt with administrator user rights (Run as Administrator) in Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.\n\n2.  To Install .NET Framework 3.5 feature files from Windows Update, use the following command:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All \n    ```\n\n    Use */All* to enable all parent features of the specified feature. For more information on DISM arguments, see [Enable or Disable Windows Features Using DISM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=259118).\n\n3.  On Windows 8 PCs, after installation .NET Framework 3.5 is displayed as enabled in **Turn Windows features on or off** in Control Panel.

By default, DISM is installed at **C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\8.0\\\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\\\Deployment Tools\\\\**. You can install DISM and other deployment and imaging tools, such as Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM), on another supported operating system from the Windows ADK.
