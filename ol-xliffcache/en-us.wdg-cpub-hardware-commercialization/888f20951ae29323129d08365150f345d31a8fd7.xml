With preinstalled applications and power policies, some computers have shown a 40 percent decrease in battery performance compared with a clean Windows® installation. However, through careful engineering, computers can achieve equal or improved performance over a clean Windows installation.\n\n## <span id=\"Determining_the_causes_of_heavy_battery_use_\"></span><span id=\"determining_the_causes_of_heavy_battery_use_\"></span><span id=\"DETERMINING_THE_CAUSES_OF_HEAVY_BATTERY_USE_\"></span>Determining the causes of heavy battery use\n\n\nYou can determine the causes of heavy battery use by looking at the way that the system uses resources. You can find many system problems by looking at processor idle time. Use a performance tool, such as Windows Assessments or the Windows Performance Toolkit, to investigate when the system has spikes in power use. Performance tools can help you target the applications that are causing increased processor use.\n\nFor more information, see [Windows Assessment Toolkit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=214554) and [Windows Performance Toolkit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228914).\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[Set the Default Power Plan](set-the-default-power-plan-technicalreference.md)\n\n[Create a Custom Power Plan](create-a-custom-power-plan-technicalreference.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
