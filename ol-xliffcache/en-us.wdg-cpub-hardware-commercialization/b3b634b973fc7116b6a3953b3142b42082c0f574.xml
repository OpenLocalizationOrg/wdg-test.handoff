Xperf performs a special image identification process during its custom trace merge that enables symbol decoding.\n\n \n\n## Remarks\n\n\nIf this action is not specified on the command line, symbol decoding is disabled.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Xperf Options](xperf-options.md)\n\n[Loading Symbols](loading-symbols.md)\n\n[Common In-Depth Analysis Issues](../assessments/common-in-depth-analysis-issues.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
