For information about how to start a recording from the command line, see [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md).\n\nWPR requires Windows 7 or later version operating system.\n\n**To start a recording**\n\n1.  On the **Start** screen, click **Windows Performance Recorder**.\n\n2.  To run the default profile, click **Start**. Or, to view and use other profiles, click **More options**.\n\n    1.  In the **Select profiles for performance recording** box, select at least one profile.\n\n    2.  You can optionally add a custom profile. To do so, click **Add Profiles**, navigate to the profile that you want, and then click **Open**. Under **Custom measurements**, select the profile.\n\n    3.  From the **Performance scenario** drop-down list, select the scenario that you want. Unless the recording is for an on/off scenario, select **General**.\n\n    4.  You can optionally record at the light detail level. (**Verbose** is the default.level.) To do so, select **Light** in the **Detail level** drop-down list.\n\n    5.  To log the recording to a file, select **File** in the **Logging mode** drop-down list. **Memory** is the default logging mode, except for on/off transition logs, which must be logged to a file.\n\n        **Caution**  \n        For longer recordings, select **Memory**. When you select **File**, the file can grow very large because the only limitation to the file size is the available disk space. Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) cannot analyze extremely large files.\n\n         \n\n3.  Click **Start** to begin recording, or click **Cancel** to end without recording.\n\n**Note**  \nIf you start WPR while another application is recording (such as Xperf or an application that uses NT Kernel Logger, such as logman or PerfTrace), WPR will not immediately detect that a recording is taking place and it will initially display a message that recording has not started. However, if you try to start a recording in WPR during the time that another application is recording, WPR will detect a conflict and prompt you with the following query:\n\n`An existing session is already running. Click OK to stop the running session and start the selected profile(s) or Cancel to abort the operation.`\n\nTo stop the current session, click **OK**. WPR will start to record. Note that this action can impact the application that started the cancelled session. To allow the current session to continue, click **Cancel**. In this case, WPR does not start a recording and the other application is not affected.\n\n \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[WPR Common Scenarios](windows-performance-recorder-common-scenarios.md)\n\n[Recording for Basic System Diagnosis](recording-for-basic-system-diagnosis.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
