# Windows Media Player Performance and Quality


The Windows Media Player Performance and Quality assessment starts Windows Media Player and plays multiple media clips one after another. The focus of this assessment is on the quality and performance of steady-state playback in Windows Media Player, which mimics the workload of a user watching a movie. The results produced by this assessment can help you assess media playing capabilities and performance and quality issues. This assessment does not evaluate any seeking or pausing functionality. For more information about the results that are produced by this assessment, see [Results for the Windows Media Player Performance and Quality Assessment](results-for-the-windows-media-player-performance-and-quality-assessment.md).

The following graphic illustrates the assessment process.
