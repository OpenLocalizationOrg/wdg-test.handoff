The Windows Assessment Console is a GUI that you can use to discover assessments and predefined jobs, group assessments to create new jobs, change existing jobs, run jobs, and manage job results. A job is a collection of one or more assessments (and their settings) that run at the same time on a computer. The results of a job often include diagnostics and remediation information that help you determine areas that need additional investigation and corrective action. For more information about how to use the Windows Assessment Console, see [Windows Assessment Console step-by-step Guide](windows-assessment-console-step-by-step-guide.md).\n\nAn assessment is a combination of .xml and binary files that induce a specific set of states on a computer, measure and record the activity, and preserve the recorded results. You can review the available assessments to determine what you want to assess. You can then add the assessments to a job or configure a predefined job to include the assessments and settings that meet your needs. For more information about individual assessments, see [Assessments](assessments.md).\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [System Requirements](#asmt-sysreq)\n\n-   [Benefits](#asmt-benefits)\n\n-   [Limitations](#asmt-limitations)\n\n-   [Common Scenarios](#asmt-scenarios)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"asmt-sysreq\"></a>System Requirements\n\n\nThe Windows Assessment Console can be installed on any of the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\n**Note**  \nSome assessments must be run on a specific operating system. For more information about system requirements for individual assessments, see [Assessments](assessments.md).\n\n \n\nIn addition, the system partition where you install the Windows Assessment Console must have a minimum of 200 megabytes (MB) of free disk space to run assessments. This requirement is needed for Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), a feature that all assessments use.

For more information about remotely assessing multiple computers at the same time, see [Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md).\n\n-   The Windows Assessment Console can't be installed on a server and isn't designed to assess server computers.\n\n-   The Windows Assessment Console can't be installed on Windows RT. But, you can package a job and run it on Windows RT if the assessment supports ARM-based processors. Not all assessments support running on ARM-based processors. For more information, see [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).
