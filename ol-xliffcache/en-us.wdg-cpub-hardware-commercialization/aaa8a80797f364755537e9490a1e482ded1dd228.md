# Drvload Command-Line Options


The Drvload tool adds out-of-box drivers to a booted Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) image. It takes one or more driver .inf files as inputs. To add a driver to an offline Windows PE image, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. For more information, see [Add and Remove Drivers to an Offline Windows Image](add-and-remove-drivers-to-an-offline-windows-image.md).

If the driver .inf file requires a reboot, Windows PE will ignore the request. If the driver .sys file requires a reboot, then the driver cannot be added with Drvload. For more information, see [Device Drivers and Deployment Overview](device-drivers-and-deployment-overview.md) and [DISM Driver Servicing Command-Line Options](dism-driver-servicing-command-line-options-s14.md).

Drivers added using the Drvload tool are marked as the preferred driver for that device. If you add an updated driver during Windows Setup, the driver that you added with Drvload takes precedence.
