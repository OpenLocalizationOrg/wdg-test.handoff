This documentation discusses both Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA).\n\n## Windows Performance Xperf Command-Line\n\n\nThe Windows Performance Toolkit consists of two independent tools: Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). In addition, support is maintained for the previous command-line tool, Xperf. However, Xperfview is no longer supported. All recordings must be opened and analyzed by using WPA.\n\nThe following are the system requirements for running Windows Performance Toolkit:\n\n-   Windows Performance Recorder (WPR): Windows 8 or later.\n\n-   Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA): Windows 8 or later with the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or later.\n\nYou can download the Windows Performance Toolkit by visiting [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/).\n\n## Contents\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Section</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>[Windows Performance Toolkit](index.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>Gives a general overview of both WPR and WPA.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>[What's New in the Windows Performance Toolkit](whats-new-in-the-windows-performance-toolkit.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>Describes the new features available in this release.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>[Windows Performance Recorder](windows-performance-recorder.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>Provides complete documentation for WPR.
