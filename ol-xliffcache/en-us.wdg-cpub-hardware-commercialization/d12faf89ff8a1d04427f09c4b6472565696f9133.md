# WinPE: Mount and Customize


Add drivers to Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE), such as graphics drivers or network drivers.

Common customizations:

-   [Add device drivers (.inf files)](winpe-add-drivers.md). You can customize device drivers, such as drivers that support network cards or storage devices.
-   [Add packages (.cab files, also known as WinPE optional components)](winpe-add-packages--optional-components-reference.md) Add languages, hotfixes, or support for features like PowerShell and the HTML Application Language (HTA).
-   [Add a language](winpe-add-packages--optional-components-reference.md). To run WinPE in multiple languages, add the packages (optional components) for those languages.
-   Add files and folders. These can be added directly to the WinPE image.
-   [Add a newer version of DISM](copy-dism-to-another-computer.md). When new versions of Windows require features from the latest version of DISM, you can add DISM directly into WinPE.
-   [Add a startup script](#addstartupscript). Examples include setting up a network connection, or adding a custom application, such as diagnostic software.
-   [Add an app](#addapp). Note, WinPE only supports legacy apps.
-   [Add temporary storage (scratch space)](#scratchspace). If your application requires temporary file storage, you can reserve extra memory space in RAM.
-   [Replace the background image](#addwallpaper)
-   [Add answer file settings](#addanswerfilesettings)

**Get the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit with Windows PE tools**

-   Install the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) Technical Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526803), including the **Windows PE** feature.

**Create a set of either 32-bit or 64-bit Windows PE files**

1.  Click **Start**, and type **deployment**. Right-click **Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment** and then select **Run as administrator**.

2.  In the **Deployment Tools and Imaging Environment**, copy the WinPE files for the PCs you want to boot.

    -   The 64-bit version can boot 64-bit UEFI and 64-bit BIOS PCs.

        ``` syntax
        copype amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64
        ```

    -   The 32-bit version of WinPE can boot 32-bit UEFI, 32-bit BIOS, and 64-bit BIOS PCs.

        ``` syntax
        copype x86 C:\WinPE_x86
        ```

**Mount the Windows PE boot image**

-   Mount the WinPE image.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:"C:\WinPE_amd64\media\sources\boot.wim" /index:1 /MountDir:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

## <span id="Add_customizations"></span><span id="add_customizations"></span><span id="ADD_CUSTOMIZATIONS"></span>Add customizations


**Add device drivers (.inf files)**

-   Add the device driver to the WinPE image.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /Add-Driver /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /Driver:"C:\SampleDriver\driver.inf"
    ```

    Although you can add multiple drivers to an image by using one command, it is often easier to troubleshoot problems by adding each driver package individually.

    To learn more about drivers, see [Add device drivers (.inf files)](winpe-add-drivers.md).

**Add packages/languages/optional components/.cab files**

-   Add the optional component into WinPE. To add optional components, you need to add both the optional component and its associated language packs.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\WinPE-HTA.cab"  

    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\en-us\WinPE-HTA_en-us.cab"
    ```

    To learn more about adding packages, see [WinPE: Add packages (Optional Components Reference)](winpe-add-packages--optional-components-reference.md).

**Add files and folders**

-   Copy files and folders into the C:\\WinPE\_amd64\\mount folder. These files will show up in the X:\\ folder in WinPE.

    Don't add too many files, as these will slow down WinPE and can fill up the available memory in the default RAMDisk environment.

<span id="AddStartupScript"></span><span id="addstartupscript"></span><span id="ADDSTARTUPSCRIPT"></span>
**Add a startup script**

-   Modify the Startnet.cmd script to include your customized commands. This file is located at `C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\Windows\System32\Startnet.cmd`.

    You can also call other batch files or command line scripts from this file.

    For Plug and Play or networking support, make sure that you include a call to **wpeinit** in your customized Startnet.cmd script. For more info, see [Wpeinit and Startnet.cmd: Using WinPE Startup Scripts](wpeinit-and-startnetcmd-using-winpe-startup-scripts.md).

<span id="AddApp"></span><span id="addapp"></span><span id="ADDAPP"></span>
**Add an app**

1.  Create an app directory inside the mounted WinPE image.

    ``` syntax
    md "C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\windows\<MyApp>"
    ```

2.  Copy the necessary app files to the local WinPE directory.

    ``` syntax
    Xcopy C:\<MyApp> "C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\windows\<MyApp>"
    ```

3.  Test the app later by booting WinPE and running the application from the X: directory.

    ``` syntax
    X:\Windows\System32> X:\Windows\<MyApp>
    ```

    If your app requires temporary storage, or if WinPE becomes unresponsive when it runs an app, you may need to increase the amount of temporary storage (scratch space) allocated to WinPE.

4.  To automatically launch a shell or application that runs when WinPE starts, add the path location to the Winpeshl.ini file. For more info, see [Winpeshl.ini Reference: Launching an app when WinPE starts](winpeshlini-reference-launching-an-app-when-winpe-starts.md).

<span id="ScratchSpace"></span><span id="scratchspace"></span><span id="SCRATCHSPACE"></span>
**Add temporary storage (scratch space)**

-   WinPE reserves memory on the X: drive to unpack the WinPE files, plus additional temporary file storage, known as scratch space, that can be used by your applications. By default, this is 512MB for PCs with more than 1GB of RAM, otherwise the default is 32MB. Valid values are 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /Set-ScratchSpace:256 /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

<span id="AddWallpaper"></span><span id="addwallpaper"></span><span id="ADDWALLPAPER"></span>
**Replace the background image**

1.  If you've got multiple versions of WinPE, you can set the background image so you can instantly tell which version of WinPE is running.

    Change the security permissions of the WinPE background image file (`\windows\system32\winpe.jpg`). This allows you to modify or delete the file.

    1.  In Windows Explorer, navigate to `C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\windows\system32`.

    2.  Right-click the `C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\windows\system32\winpe.jpg` file, and select **Properties** &gt; **Security** tab &gt; **Advanced**.

    3.  Next to Owner, select **Change**. Change the owner to **Administrators**.

    4.  Apply the changes, and exit the Properties window to save changes.

    5.  Right-click the `C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\windows\system32\winpe.jpg` file, and select **Properties** &gt; **Security** tab &gt; **Advanced**.

    6.  Modify the permissions for **Administrators** to allow full access.

    7.  Apply the changes, and exit the Properties window to save changes.

2.  Replace the `winpe.jpg` file with your own image file.

<span id="AddAnswerFileSettings"></span><span id="addanswerfilesettings"></span><span id="ADDANSWERFILESETTINGS"></span>
**Add answer file settings**

-   Some WinPE settings can be managed by using an answer file, such as firewall, network, and display settings. Create an answer file, name it unattend.xml, and add it to the root of the WinPE media to process these settings. For more information, see [Wpeinit and Startnet.cmd: Using WinPE Startup Scripts](wpeinit-and-startnetcmd-using-winpe-startup-scripts.md).

**Unmount the Windows PE image and create media**

1.  Unmount the WinPE image.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /commit
    ```

2.  Create bootable media, such as a USB flash drive.

    ``` syntax
    MakeWinPEMedia /UFD C:\WinPE_amd64 F:
    ```

3.  Boot the media. WinPE starts automatically. After the WinPE window appears, the wpeinit command runs automatically. This may take a few minutes. Verify your customizations.

-   WinPE won’t boot? See the troubleshooting tips at the end of the topic: [WinPE: Create USB Bootable drive](winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive.md)
-   For tips on connecting to a network, see [WinPE Network Drivers: Initializing and adding drivers](winpe-network-drivers-initializing-and-adding-drivers.md).
-   If the WinPE image becomes unserviceable, you may need to clean up the images before you can mount the image again. For information, see [Repair a Windows Image](repair-a-windows-image.md).

### <span id="To_delete_a_working_directory_"></span><span id="to_delete_a_working_directory_"></span><span id="TO_DELETE_A_WORKING_DIRECTORY_"></span>To delete a working directory:

In some cases, you may not be able to recover the mounted image. DISM protects you from accidentally deleting the working directory, so you may have to try the following steps to get access to delete the mounted directory. Try each of the following steps:

1.  Try remounting the image:

    ``` syntax
    dism /Remount-Image /MountDir:C:\mount
    ```

2.  Try unmounting the image, discarding the changes:

    ``` syntax
    dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:C:\mount /discard
    ```

3.  Try cleaning up the resources associated with the mounted image:

    ``` syntax
    dism /Cleanup-Mountpoints
    ```
