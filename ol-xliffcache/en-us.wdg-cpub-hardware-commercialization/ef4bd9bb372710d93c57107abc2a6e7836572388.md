## <span id="Prerequisites"></span><span id="prerequisites"></span><span id="PREREQUISITES"></span>Prerequisites


To complete this walkthrough, you need the following:

-   A technician computer that has the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) installed.

-   Windows product DVD.

## <span id="bkmk_1"></span><span id="BKMK_1"></span>Step 1: Copy Windows Distribution Files to a Local Directory


In this step, you copy the contents of your Windows product media to a local hard drive. You must use the Windows media that corresponds to the version of the customized image that you are building. For example, if you are building a custom Windows 8 setup image, you must use the original Windows 8 product media.

-   On your technician computer, create a new directory for your Windows distribution and copy the Windows media content to that directory. For example:

    ``` syntax
    md C:\my_distribution
    xcopy D: C:\my_distribution
    md C:\mount\boot 
    md C:\mount\windows
    ```

    Where *D:* is the location of the Windows product media.

## <span id="bkmk_2"></span><span id="BKMK_2"></span>Step 2: Add Windows PE Setup Language Packs to the Default Boot Image


In this step, you add language support and the Windows Setup optional components to the second image (index 2) in the default Boot.wim.

1.  On your technician computer: Click **Start**, and type **deployment**. Right-click **Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment** and then select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Mount the second image (index 2) in Boot.wim to a local mount directory using the **Dism /Mount-Image** command. For example:

    ``` syntax
    Dism /mount-image /imagefile:C:\my_distribution\sources\boot.wim /index:2 /mountdir:C:\Mount\boot
    ```

3.  Add Windows PE Setup optional component and language packs into your mounted image using the **Dism /Add-Package** command for each language you want to support.

    Windows PE language packs are available in the Windows ADK.

    For example:

    ``` syntax

    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot /add-package /packagepath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\lp.cab"

    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot /add-package /packagepath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\WinPE-Setup_fr-fr.cab"

    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot /add-package /packagepath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\WinPE-Setup-Client_fr-fr.cab"
    ```

    **Important**  
    For Windows Server® 2012, you must use the WinPE-Setup-Server optional component and associated language pack.

     

4.  For Japanese (ja-JP), Korean (ko-KR), and Chinese (zh-HK, zh-CN, zh-TW), you must add additional font support to your image. For example, to add Japanese font support, enter the following command.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot /add-package /packagepath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\WinPE-FontSupport-JA-JP.cab"
    ```

5.  Recreate the Lang.ini file to reflect the additional language support using the **Dism /Gen-LangINI** command.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot /gen-langINI /distribution:C:\my_distribution
    ```

6.  Change the Windows Setup default language by using DISM. For example,

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot /Set-SetupUILang:fr-FR /distribution:C:\windows_distribution
    ```

    For more information about specifying different international settings for input locale, and other items see [DISM Languages and International Servicing Command-Line Options](dism-languages-and-international-servicing-command-line-options.md).

7.  Save your changes back into the image using the **Dism /Unmount–Image /Commit** command.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /unmount-image /mountdir:C:\mount\boot /commit
    ```

## <span id="bkmk_3"></span><span id="BKMK_3"></span>Step 3: Add Font Support to the Default Boot Image


If you added font support for Japanese (ja-JP), Korean (ko-KR), or Chinese (zh-HK, zh-CN, zh-TW) to the default boot.wim image, you must also add font support to the first image (index 1) in the Boot.wim file.

1.  On your technician computer: Click **Start**, and type **deployment**. Right-click **Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment** and then select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Use the **Dism /Mount-Image** command to mount the first image (index 1) in the Boot.wim file to a local mount directory. For example:

    ``` syntax
    Md C:\mount\boot1
    Dism /mount-image /imagefile:C:\my_distribution\sources\boot.wim /index:1 /mountdir:C:\Mount\boot1
    ```

3.  Add the same font support you added to the boot.wim default boot image in the previous step. For example, to add Japanese font support, enter the following command.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\boot1 /add-package /packagepath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\WinPE-FontSupport-JA-JP.cab"
    ```

4.  Save your changes back into the image using the **Dism /Unmount-Image /Commit** command.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /unmount-image /mountdir:C:\mount\boot1 /commit
    ```

## <span id="bkmk_4"></span><span id="BKMK_4"></span>Step 4: Add Language Packs to the Windows Image


You must add the same language support to your Windows image file, Install.wim, as you did for the Boot.wim file. The setup process requires that both images contain the same set of language packs. For more information, see [Add and Remove Language Packs Offline Using DISM](add-and-remove-language-packs-offline-using-dism.md).

-   Mount the Windows image by using DISM

    ``` syntax
    Dism /mount-image /imagefile:"C:\my_distribution\sources\install.wim" /index: 1 /mountdir:"C:\mount\windows"
    ```

    Where *1* is the index of the image that you want to mount.

    Add one or more language packs to the Windows image.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\windows /add-package /packagepath:"C:\LanguagePacks\fr-FR\lp.cab" 
    ```

The same set of languages must also be added to the Windows Recovery Environment image (winre.wim). For more information, see [Customize Windows RE](customize-windows-re.md).

## <span id="Step5"></span><span id="step5"></span><span id="STEP5"></span>Step 5: Add Localized Windows Setup Resources to the Windows Distribution


In this step you copy the language-specific Setup resources from each language specific Windows distribution to the Sources folder in your Windows distribution. For example, insert the Windows DVD for Fr-FR in your DVD drive (E:) and copy the Fr-FR sources folder to your Windows distribution.

-   Copy the localized Windows setup files to your Windows distribution.

    ``` syntax
    xcopy E:\sources\fr-fr C:\my_distribution\sources\fr-fr /cherkyi 
    ```

    Where *E:* is the location of the Windows distribution that contains the localized Windows Setup resources.

## <span id="Step6"></span><span id="step6"></span><span id="STEP6"></span>Step 6: Recreate the Lang.ini


In this step you recreate the Lang.ini file and specify the default language settings.

1.  Recreate the Lang.ini file to reflect the additional language using the **Dism /Gen-LangINI** command.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\windows /gen-langINI /distribution:C:\my_distribution
    ```

2.  Change the Windows Setup default language by using DISM. For example,

    ``` syntax
    Dism /image:C:\mount\windows /Set-SetupUILang:fr-FR /distribution:C:\my_distribution
    ```

    For more information about specifying different international settings for input locale, and other items see [DISM Languages and International Servicing Command-Line Options](dism-languages-and-international-servicing-command-line-options.md).

3.  Copy the lang.ini file in the Windows distribution to the boot.wim file.

    ``` syntax
    Xcopy C:\my_distribution\sources\lang.ini C:\mount\boot\sources\lang.ini
    ```

## <span id="Step7"></span><span id="step7"></span><span id="STEP7"></span>Step 7: Commit the Changes to the Windows Images


In this step you commit the changes to all of the Windows images you have updated

-   Use DISM to unmount and commit the changes to the Windows images.

    ``` syntax
    Dism /unmount-image /mountdir:C:\mount\boot /commit 
    Dism /unmount-image /mountdir:C:\mount\windows /commit
    ```

## <span id="Step8"></span><span id="step8"></span><span id="STEP8"></span>Step 8: Create a Boot Order File (Optional)


In this step, you create a boot order file. Due to the size of the image, you must do so before you create an .iso file.

-   Create a boot order file (Bootorder.txt). For example:

    ``` syntax
    Oscdimg -m -n -yoC:\temp\bootOrder.txt -bC:\winpe_amd64\Efisys.bin C:\winpe_amd64\winpeamd64.iso
    ```

    where Bootorder.txt contains the following list of files:

    ``` syntax
    boot\bcd
    boot\boot.sdi
    boot\bootfix.bin
    boot\bootsect.exe
    boot\etfsboot.com
    boot\memtest.efi
    boot\memtest.exe
    boot\en-us\bootsect.exe.mui
    boot\fonts\chs_boot.ttf
    boot\fonts\cht_boot.ttf
    boot\fonts\jpn_boot.ttf
    boot\fonts\kor_boot.ttf
    boot\fonts\wgl4_boot.ttf
    sources\boot.wim
    ```

## <span id="Next_Steps"></span><span id="next_steps"></span><span id="NEXT_STEPS"></span>Next Steps


You can now use the multilingual image to create media for distribution. To create bootable media such as a USB flash drive, see [WinPE: Create USB Bootable drive](winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive.md). You can also create a bootable CD or DVD. However, due to the size of a multilingual image, you must first create a boot order file before you create a bootable image (.iso) file on CD or DVD. For more information, see [Oscdimg Command-Line Options](oscdimg-command-line-options.md).
