In this scenario, an HTTP streaming server application that's installed on a second or remote computer streams content to the computer that's running the assessment. This topic describes how to set up the streaming server.\n\n**Note**  \nAny computer that has the Windows Assessment Toolkit installed can act as a streaming server and can provide the media files that were installed via the Windows Assessment Toolkit to any requesting client. For this assessment, a workload is a .mp4 file and a corresponding .html file that the assessment uses together as streaming media. For example, 720p.mp4 and 720p.html together form a 720p workload. To use those media workloads in your 2-computer assessment scenario, complete the following steps.\n\n \n\n**To set up a server for the Streaming Media Performance assessment**\n\n1.  On the remote server, install the Windows Assessment Toolkit. For instructions, see [Windows Assessment Console step-by-step guide](windows-assessment-console-step-by-step-guide.md) or [Windows Assessment Services step-by-step guide](windows-assessment-services-step-by-step-guide-was.md).\n\n2.  Open a command prompt.\n\n3.

The local computer where you run the Streaming Media Performance assessment requests these files from the remote server during the assessment process. The remote server caches any file that the *PopulateCache* parameter has specified and provides them to the local computer for performance measurement.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Streaming Media Performance](streaming-media-performance.md)\n\n[Assessments](assessments.md)\n\n[Windows Assessment Console](windows-assessment-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
