baseline operating system image against another operating system image. You can then identify the specific components that affect the memory footprint of the physical system. These components can include drivers, add-in applications, preloaded software packages, and antivirus programs.\n\nBy using the Memory Footprint assessment, you can compare the effect that different hardware configurations and associated software have on system memory. After you compare two system images in a side-by-side review, you can decide to change drivers or optimize the memory footprint of your system in other ways.\n\n**Note**  \nThis assessment creates a snapshot of memory use during a series of assessment boots of the system and immediately after the appearance of the desktop in Windows 10 or the start screen in Windows 10 Enterprise. It does not evaluate memory use during ordinary computer operations. For more information about the results this assessment produces, see [Results for the Memory Footprint Assessment](results-for-the-memory-footprint-assessment.md).\n\n \n\nThe following graphic shows the assessment process. As the graphic illustrates, the assessment requires multiple system reboots to generate all the assessment results.\n\n![memory footprint workflow](images/dep-win8-8-techref-memoryfootprint.jpg)\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [Before You Begin](#beforebegin)\n\n-   [Settings](#assesssettings)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"beforebegin\"></a>Before You Begin\n\n\nThis assessment includes system reboots as a regular part of the assessment process. To configure your computer to run assessment jobs automatically without manual reboots or system prompts, see [Automate reboots before you run an assessment](automate-reboots-before-you-run-an-assessment.md).\n\n### System Requirements\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems.\n\nThere are two ways to run this assessment on Windows RT:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows Assessment Console and then run it on Windows RT. For more information about this option, see. [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services to run assessments on Windows RT.
