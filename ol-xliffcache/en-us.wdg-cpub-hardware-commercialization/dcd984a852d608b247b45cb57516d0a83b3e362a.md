# Open a Recording


You can open any recording that Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) or the Assessment Platform created in Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA).

**To open a recording in WPA**

1.  On the **File** menu, click **Open**.

2.  Browse to the location of the event trace log (ETL) file for the recording.

    By default, WPR saves ETL files to the user's Documents folder in a folder that it creates called WPR Files.

3.  Click the desired file, and then click **Open**.

**To open a recording from assessment results**

-   On the View Results page, click the **WPA in-depth analysis** link in the **Issues** pane.

    You may need to expand the issue to see this link. Not all issues have a link to WPA.

**To view graphs on the Analysis tab**

1.  In the Graph Explorer window, expand the desired node by clicking the triangle.

2.  Drag a graph or graphs from the Graph Explorer window to the **Analysis** tab.

    You will see a tree view of the lines on the graph to the left of the graph itself. This is called the **Legend** control. On the right side of the graph title bar, there are layout icons to select the layout for the graph. By default, the center icon is selected and only the graph and its **Legend** control are displayed. If you select the layout icon on the left, the data table associated with the graph appears below the **Legend** control and graph. This table contains the same data as the graph. If you select the layout icon on the right, only the data table is displayed.
