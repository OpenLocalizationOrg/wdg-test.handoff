# Add a Driver Online in Audit Mode


You can use an answer file to automate the installation of device drivers when the computer is booted in audit mode.

## <span id="bkmk_2"></span><span id="BKMK_2"></span>Adding a Device Driver


The [auditSystem](auditsystem.md) configuration pass processes unattended Setup settings while Windows is running in system context, before a user logs on to the computer in audit mode. The **auditSystem** configuration pass runs only if the computer is booted in audit mode. To add device drivers during the **auditSystem** configuration pass, add the [Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn923009) component to your answer file in the **auditSystem** configuration pass, and specify the path for each device driver. After you run Setup, boot Windows in audit mode. You can run the **Sysprep** command with the **/audit** option to configure the computer to start in audit mode the next time that it boots. Or, in the answer file, you can configure the Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\\Reseal\\`Mode` setting to **audit**. For more information, see [Unattended Windows Setup Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn923277).

1.  Locate the .inf files that you want to install during audit mode for the device driver.

2.  On your technician computer, open Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM). Click **Start**, type **Windows System Image Manager**, and then select **Windows System Image Manager**.

3.  Open your answer file and expand the **Components** node to display available settings.

4.  Add the Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE component to your answer file in the **auditSystem** configuration pass.

5.  Expand the **Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE** node in the answer file. Right-click **DevicePaths**, and then click **Insert New PathAndCredentials**.

    A new **PathAndCredentials** list item appears.

6.  For each location that you access, add a separate **PathAndCredentials** list item.

7.  In the Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE component, specify the path of the device driver and the credentials that are used to access the file if the file is on a network share.

    **Note**  
    You can include multiple device-driver paths by adding multiple **PathAndCredentials** list items. If you add multiple list items, you must increment the value of `Key` for each path. For example, if you add two separate driver paths, the first path uses the `Key` value of **1**, and the second path uses the `Key` value of **2**.

     

8.  Save the answer file and close Windows SIM. The answer file must resemble this example:

    ``` syntax
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
    <unattend xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:unattend">
       <settings pass="auditSystem">
          <component name="Microsoft-Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE" processorArchitecture="x86" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" language="neutral" versionScope="nonSxS" xmlns:wcm="http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
             <DriverPaths>
                <PathAndCredentials wcm:keyValue="1" wcm:action="add">
                   <Credentials>
                      <Domain>Fabrikam</Domain> 
                      <Password>MyPassword</Password> 
                      <Username>MyUserName</Username> 
                   </Credentials>
                   <Path>\\networkshare\share\drivers</Path> 
                </PathAndCredentials>
             </DriverPaths>
          </component>
       </settings>
    </unattend>
    ```

9.  Boot in Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE), run Windows Setup, and specify the name of the answer file. For example:

    ``` syntax
    Setup /unattend:C:\unattend.xml
    ```

    The specified answer file is cached to the system so that when you run audit mode, the computer applies settings in the answer file.

    Setup finishes.

10. Run the **Sysprep** command with the **/audit** option to configure the computer to start in audit mode the next time that it boots. For example:

    ``` syntax
    Sysprep /audit /reboot
    ```

    When Windows reboots in audit mode, device drivers that you specified in the answer file are added.

You can use the PNPUtil tool to add, remove, and enumerate drivers on a running operating system. For more information about how to use PNPUtil to add or remove Plug and Play drivers, see [Install a Plug and Play Device](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139151).
