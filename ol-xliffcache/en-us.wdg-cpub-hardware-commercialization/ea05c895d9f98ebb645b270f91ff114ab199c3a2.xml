You can use a single system provider and multiple event providers in a profile, including a heap event provider.\n\n## System Providers\n\n\nA system provider provides kernel events. System providers are defined by using the following:\n\n-   Keywords for the events to be collected.\n\n-   Stacks from which to collect events.\n\n-   Pool tags to indicate the component that made the allocation or the allocation type.\n\nFor a description of supported system keywords, see [Keyword (in SystemProvider)](keyword--in-systemprovider-.md).\n\n## Event Providers\n\n\nYou can configure event providers to provide certain types of events (among those that are supported by the provider) by specifying a hexadecimal bitmask keyword. Because providers support different events, there are no string constants for these keywords. Therefore, they must be hexadecimal-style strings.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[WPR Features](wpr-features.md)\n\n[2.
