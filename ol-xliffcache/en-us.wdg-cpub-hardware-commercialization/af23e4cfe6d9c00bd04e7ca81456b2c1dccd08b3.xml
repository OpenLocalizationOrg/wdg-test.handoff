This **Oobe.xml** file should contain the *&lt;eulafilename&gt;* node with the name of the customized EULA that you plan to use.\n\nPlace an **Oobe.xml** for each Windows language that you're including in **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Default\\\\**&lt;*language that you're deploying in*&gt;. These files should contain the default regional settings that you plan to show for a given language, as well as a default set of customizations, in case the user selects a country/region that you haven't made specific customizations for.\n\nPlace an **Oobe.xml** file for each country/region that contains customized content in **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\&lt;***country/region that you're deploying to*&gt;\\\\&lt;*language that you're deploying in*&gt;. After the user has chosen a country/region, this file is used to display your additional customizations.\n\nFor example, a version of Windows with English and French language packs that's delivered to the United States and Canada would use the following directory structure:\n\n-   Logo and EULA:\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\Oobe.xml** (logo and EULA file name)\n\n-   Regional settings and fallback for content that's not localized for the specific country/region:\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\Default\\\\1033\\\\Oobe.xml** (default regional settings and English content if the user chooses a country/region other than the United States or Canada)\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\Default\\\\1036\\\\Oobe.xml** (default regional settings and French content if the user chooses a country/region other than United States or Canada)\n\n-   Country-specific or region-specific content in the appropriate languages\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\244\\\\1033\\\\Oobe.xml** (United States custom content in English)\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\244\\\\1036\\\\Oobe.xml** (United States custom content in French)\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\39\\\\1033\\\\Oobe.xml** (Canada custom content in English)\n\n    **\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\Oobe\\\\Info\\\\39\\\\1036\\\\Oobe.xml** (Canada custom content in French)\n\n### <span id=\"Country_region_folder_format\"></span><span id=\"country_region_folder_format\"></span><span id=\"COUNTRY_REGION_FOLDER_FORMAT\"></span>Country/region folder format\n\nTo identify the country/region:\n\n1.  Look up the country/region GeoID identifier using the [Table of Geographical Locations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131360) on **MSDN**. These values are presented in hexadecimal.\n\n2.  Convert the value from hexadecimal to decimal, and use that value for the folder name. For example, to create a folder for Chile (GeoID 0x2E), name the folder \"46\".\n\n    ``` syntax\n    \\%WINDIR%\\System32\\Oobe\\Info\\46\\Oobe.xml\n    ```\n\n### <span id=\"Language_folder_format\"></span><span id=\"language_folder_format\"></span><span id=\"LANGUAGE_FOLDER_FORMAT\"></span>Language folder format\n\nTo identify the language, use the decimal version of the Locale ID (LCID) value. For example, to create a Spanish folder, name the folder \"3082\".\n\n``` syntax\n%WINDIR%\\System32\\Oobe\\Info\\Default\\3082\\Oobe.xml\n```\n\nThere are many more LCIDs than languages. A few LCIDs correlate to the languages that can be released with Windows. For more information about which languages release with Windows, at what level of localization, and their decimal identifiers, see [Available Language Packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=206620) on **TechNet**.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
