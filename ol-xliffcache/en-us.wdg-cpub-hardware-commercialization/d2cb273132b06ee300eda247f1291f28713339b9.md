# Windows Setup States


There are several states assigned to a Windows® image during installation. This state information can be used to detect automatically the different states and stages of Windows Setup.

## <span id="WindowsSetupStates"></span><span id="windowssetupstates"></span><span id="WINDOWSSETUPSTATES"></span>Windows Setup State Information


The Windows image state is stored in two locations, in the registry and in a file.

-   In the registry:

    KEY: **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Setup\\State**

    TYPE: REG\_SZ

    VALUE: *StateName*

-   In a file:

    FILE: %WINDIR%\\Setup\\State\\State.ini

    SECTION: \[State\]

    VALUE: *StateName*

The following table describes the values that exist for *StateName*.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">State name</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>IMAGE_STATE_COMPLETE</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The image has successfully been installed. The <strong>specialize</strong> and <strong>oobeSystem</strong> configuration passes are complete. This image is not deployable to a computer that has a different hardware configuration because it is now hardware-dependent. To deploy this image to a computer that has a different hardware configuration, you must run <strong>sysprep /generalize</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>IMAGE_STATE _UNDEPLOYABLE</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This is the default state for an image in a given phase of Windows Setup that is not yet complete. If a process queries the IMAGE_STATE value and IMG_UNDEPLOYABLE is returned, the image is in one of the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Setup is currently running and has not fully completed the phase. Once a given phase is complete, the IMAGE_STATE will be set to an appropriate completion value.</p></li>
<li><p>If queried online when Setup is not running, there was a failure when completing a Setup phase. This image must be reinstalled.</p></li>
<li><p>If queried offline, the image did not finish a phase and will never be deployable.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>IMAGE_STATE_GENERALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The image has successfully completed the <strong>generalize</strong> configuration pass and will continue into <strong>OOBEsystem</strong> configuration pass when Setup is initiated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>IMAGE_STATE_GENERALIZE_RESEAL_TO_AUDIT</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The image has successfully completed the <strong>generalize</strong> configuration pass and will continue into audit mode when Setup is initiated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>IMAGE_STATE_SPECIALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The image has successfully completed the <strong>specialize</strong> pass and will continue into <strong>OOBEsystem</strong> configuration pass when Setup is initiated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>IMAGE_STATE_SPECIALIZE_RESEAL_TO_AUDIT</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The image has successfully completed the <strong>specialize</strong> configuration pass and will continue into audit mode when Setup is initiated.</p></td>
</tr>

The following examples show how to access state information.

-   To access state information from the registry:

    ``` syntax
    C:\>reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\State /v Imag
    eState

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\State
        ImageState    REG_SZ    IMAGE_STATE_SPECIALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE
    ```

-   To access state information from a file:

    ``` syntax
    C:\>type %windir%\Setup\State\State.ini
    [State]
    ImageState="IMAGE_STATE_SPECIALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE"
    ```
