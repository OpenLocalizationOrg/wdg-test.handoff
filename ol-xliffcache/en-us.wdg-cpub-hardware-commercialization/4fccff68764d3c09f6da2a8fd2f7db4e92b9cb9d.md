# Reporting operating mode capabilities


If a Wi-Fi driver supports running in manufacturing mode, it should add manufacturing mode to its list of supported capabilities. You can query the supported operation mode capabilities by using the **OID\_DOT11\_OPERATION\_MODE\_CAPABILITY** command, which will return information on the operation modes supported by the driver. For more info about **OID\_DOT11\_OPERATION\_MODE\_CAPABILITY**, see [Supporting updated OID behavior in manufacturing mode](supporting-updated-oid-behavior-in-manufacturing-mode.md).

To switch the driver’s operation mode to manufacturing mode, use the **OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_OPERATION\_MODE** command to ensure that manufacturing testing will not conflict with the driver’s behavior in any of its other modes. For more info about **OID\_DOT11\_CURRENT\_OPERATION\_MODE**, see [Supporting updated OID behavior in manufacturing mode](supporting-updated-oid-behavior-in-manufacturing-mode.md).
