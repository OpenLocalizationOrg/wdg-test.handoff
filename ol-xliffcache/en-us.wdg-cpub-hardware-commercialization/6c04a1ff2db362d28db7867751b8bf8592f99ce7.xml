For example, when an employee leaves the organization.\n-   The device has malfunctioned and the user wants to reset the device.\n-   An OEM has completed factory testing and wants to reset the device (optionally preserving preloaded map data).\n\n**Important**  \nWhen you reset a device, it does not return it to the original factory state. For example, any packages that were added or modified during an update remain. To return the device to the original factory state, you must flash it with the original factory image.\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"Ways_to_reset_a_mobile_device\"></span><span id=\"ways_to_reset_a_mobile_device\"></span><span id=\"WAYS_TO_RESET_A_MOBILE_DEVICE\"></span>Ways to reset a mobile device\n\n\nThe following reset options are available to different types of users.\n\n### <span id=\"End_users\"></span><span id=\"end_users\"></span><span id=\"END_USERS\"></span>End users\n\nEnd users can invoke a reset by the following options:\n\n-   If Settings is accessible, tap **Settings** &gt; **System** &gt; **About** &gt; **Reset your phone**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If the device is not responsive, the user should first try restarting it; see [Restarting the OS](#restarting) later in this topic.\n\n     \n\n-   If Settings is not accessible, perform the following steps:\n\n    1.

For more info, see the [Windows Phone Exchange ActiveSync Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=270085) white paper on the Microsoft Download Center.\n\n-   A reset can be invoked by using OMA DM.

If the reset operation is initiated by using the ResetPhoneEx function with the **RESET\\_PRESERVE\\_USER\\_STORE\\_DATA** flag, the operation also scans the user data partition.\n\n-   It executes a quick format of the user data partition.
