# Authoring Recording Profiles


You can author Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) recording profiles in an XML file that has a .wprp extension. Recording profiles contain all the necessary information to enable performance recording for a specific scenario. This data includes information about Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) sessions, providers, and keywords. Each .wprp file contains at least one profile definition, which consolidates a specific set of ETW sessions and providers. A profile definition also includes the session and provider attributes that start and control performance recording.

WPR profiles support the following ETW features:

-   Sequential file and circular memory logging modes.

-   User-specified number of buffers and buffer sizes for each session.

-   ETW system logger sessions together with the NT Kernel Logger. This merger includes the ability to specify keywords, stacks, and memory pool tags.

-   Event sessions that specify a provider name or GUID, keywords, stack, detail level, and non-paged memory.

-   Capturing state providers that capture state during start or save operations only.

The .wprp file must contain specific definitions that are listed in a specific order. The following topics describe how to author the definitions in that order.

## Authoring .wprp files in Visual Studio


You can use Visual Studio to author a recording profile by using the WPR schema file, WPRControlProfiles.xsd, that is available in the WPT install folder:

1.  Open your .wprp file in Visual Studio.

2.  In the main menu, choose **XML**, and then choose **Schemas…**

3.  In the **XML Schemas** dialog that appears, choose **Add…**

4.  Choose the WPRControlProfiles.xsd schema. By default, this file is in the WPT install directory:

    -   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Windows Performance Toolkit`

Once you have selected the schema, you can use context-sensitive IntelliSense to author your .wprp file.
