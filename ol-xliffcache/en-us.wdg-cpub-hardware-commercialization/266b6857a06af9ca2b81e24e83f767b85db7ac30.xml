The **/Append-Image** option appends a volume image to an existing .wim file allowing you to store many customized Windows images in a fraction of the space. When you combine two or more Windows image files into a single .wim, any files that are duplicated between the images are only stored once.\n\n## <span id=\"multiple_windows_images_in_a_.wim_file\"></span><span id=\"MULTIPLE_WINDOWS_IMAGES_IN_A_.WIM_FILE\"></span>Multiple Windows Images in a .wim file\n\n\nBefore you can append data to an image, you must have the following:\n\n-   A technician computer running Windows 8 or a technician computer with the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) tools installed on it.\n\n-   A Windows image (.wim) file. For more information about how to capture an image using DISM, see [Capture Images of Hard Disk Partitions Using DISM](capture-images-of-hard-disk-partitions-using-dism.md).\n\n**To append a volume image to an existing image**\n\n1.  Open a command prompt with administrator privileges. If you are using a version of Windows other than Windows 8, navigate to the DISM directory.\n\n2.  Append a volume image to an existing image. For example, you can append an image of the D drive to an existing image called my-windows-partition.wim.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Dism /Append-Image /ImageFile:c:\\my-windows-partition.wim /CaptureDir:D:\\ /Name:Drive-D\n    ```\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1.  You can apply the image by referring to it by image number or image name, for example:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Dism /apply-image /imagefile:install.wim /name:Drive-D /ApplyDir:D:\\\n    ```\n\n2.  You can extract the image into a separate file by using the **/Export-Image** option. For example:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Dism /Export-Image /SourceImageFile:install.wim /SourceName:Drive-D /DestinationImageFile:DriveD.wim\n    ```\n\nFor more information, see [DISM Image Management Command-Line Options](dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14.md).\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[Capture Images of Hard Disk Partitions Using DISM](capture-images-of-hard-disk-partitions-using-dism.md)\n\n[DISM Image Management Command-Line Options](dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
