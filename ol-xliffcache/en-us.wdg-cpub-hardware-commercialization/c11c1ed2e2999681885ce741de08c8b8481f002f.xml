Like the MMOS WIM image, the test image that will never ship is used on the device. This mean that additional manufacturing tools (transports, extenders) can be included and manufacturing only native APIs can be called.\n\n![oem\\-manu\\-simple\\-refresh\\-flow\\-apollo](images/oem-manu-simple-refresh-flow-apollo.png)\n\nThis approach makes it possible, if appropriate, to use a different version of the operating system for testing. This may be a useful interim measure as test applications are being migrated to Windows 10 Mobile.\n\nOne tradeoff in this approach is that the manufacturing line must be designed to accommodate the reflashing time that occurs near the end of the manufacturing process.\n\nFor more info on working with the flashing tools, see [Flashing tools](flashing-tools.md).\n\n## <span id=\"Example_test\"></span><span id=\"example_test\"></span><span id=\"EXAMPLE_TEST\"></span>Example test area by manufacturing phase\n\n\nTest area by manufacturing phase is provided only as an example; each manufacturer may wish to sequence the tests differently.\n\n**Modem testing (RF / cellular testing)**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Modem RF calibration</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Wi-Fi RX/TX Power</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Bluetooth RX/TX Power</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n**Device testing**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Display</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Keypad</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SIM interface</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Storage card</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Camera</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>RTC</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Speaker</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Microphone</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Sensor – ALS</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Sensor – Magnetometer</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Sensor – Proximity</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Sensor – Accelerometer</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Handset interface</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Power - stand by current</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n**Device provisioning**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>IMEI</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SIM Lock</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Bluetooth MAC</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Sensors calibration</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Security provisioning</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>MO provisioning</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
