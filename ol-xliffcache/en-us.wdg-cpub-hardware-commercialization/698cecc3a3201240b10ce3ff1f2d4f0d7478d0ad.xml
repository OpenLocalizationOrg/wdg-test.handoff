of states on a computer, measure and record the activity, and preserve the recorded results. The results provide metrics and sometimes recommendations for resolving issues that the assessments found. Assessments help you assess hardware or software that has been added to a computer.\n\nAssessments and the Windows Assessment Console are available as part of the Windows Assessment Toolkit that's available in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK). After you install the Windows Assessment Toolkit, you can use the Windows Assessment Console to create and run a job that includes one or more assessments. You can also package jobs to run them on computers that don't have the Windows Assessment Toolkit installed.\n\nAssessments are also available when you install Windows Assessment Services and the Windows Assessment Services - Client (Windows ASC).\n\nThis diagram shows the general workflow for an assessment:\n\n![workflow graphic for assessments](images/dep-win8-adk-assessmentoverviewflowchart.jpg)\n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>[Connected Standby energy efficiency](connected-standby-energy-efficiency.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>This assessment measures the impact of software and devices on the battery life of a system while it is in Connected Standby.
