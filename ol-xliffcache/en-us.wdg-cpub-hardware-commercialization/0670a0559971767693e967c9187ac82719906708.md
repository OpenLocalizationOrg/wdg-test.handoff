# View a Recording Status


After you start a recording in Windows Performance Recorder (WPR), you can follow the status of the recording as it transpires. This article describes the recording status.

## <a href="" id="viewstat"></a>


When you start a recording by using the WPR user interface (UI), the recording status immediately displays on the WPR screen. If you start a recording by using the WPR command-line interface, you can view the recording status by using either of the following methods:

-   In the command prompt window, type `wpr –status`. For more information about this command, see [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md#status).

-   Open the WPR UI. The status of the recording that you started from the WPR command line will display.

For more information about how to use these methods to start a WPR recording, see [Start a Recording](start-a-recording.md) and [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md).

**Note**  
WPR can only display a recording’s status if the recording is started by WPR. It cannot display recording status for recordings that are started by Xperf or other applications.

 

The recording status displays the following information:

-   **Recording Time**: This is the length of time that the recording has been running.

-   **Buffer**: This is the buffer size that the recording is using. It is displayed in both MB and percentage of available pooled memory.

-   **Events dropped**: The number of lost events since the recording was started. For more information about this issue, see [Avoid Lost Events](avoid-lost-events.md).
