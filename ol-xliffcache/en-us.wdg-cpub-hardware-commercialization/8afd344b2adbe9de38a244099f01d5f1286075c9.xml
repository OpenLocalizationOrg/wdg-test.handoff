OEMs\n\n\nThe Windows 8.1 upgrade retains the majority of OEM customizations, including OEM branding, apps, help and support information, drivers, and OEM store listings. Some OEM solutions, including a custom Help and Support experience or custom recovery solution might not persist through the upgrade. To mitigate any potential problems for your customers, test the end-to-end upgrade experience.\n\nThe Windows 8.1 can be installed from the Windows Store or from media.\n\nUpgrade options for Windows 8.1 include:\n\n-   **Full Upgrade** preserves apps, user data, user accounts, and PC settings.\n\n-   **Data Only** preserves user accounts and data, but doesn’t preserve desktop application installs or OS settings. Drivers that are critical for installation (storage and networking drivers) are migrated to the new installation.\n\n-   **Clean install** doesn’t save any data or Windows configurations.\n\nAll personal files, and Windows files and directories, are moved to a Windows.old folder, and can be accessed after Windows Setup is complete. Personal files will remain in Windows.old. After a period of time, Windows files from the previous installation are removed.\n\nThe supported options for upgrade are:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Previous OS</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Full Upgrade</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Data Only</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Clean Install</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows 8 (from Windows Store)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows RT (from Windows Store)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows 8 (from Media)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows 7 (from Media)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nWindows 8.1 upgrade installations from Windows Vista and Windows XP aren’t supported.\n\n## <span id=\"ROLLBACK\"></span><span id=\"rollback\"></span>System Rollback log files\n\n\nRollback to the previous installation occurs when the Windows upgrade fails.
