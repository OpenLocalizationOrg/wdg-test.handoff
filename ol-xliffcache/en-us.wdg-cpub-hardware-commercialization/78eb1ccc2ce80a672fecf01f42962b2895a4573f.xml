Waking up the SoC causes the system to exit **DRIPS**, increases the average power floor and reduces battery life. This is known as a spurious wake.\n\nThe analysis process related to spurious wakes is fairly straightforward.\n\n1.  Download the pre-generated **sleepstudy-report\\_1.html** report [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/6/6/2662D67D-58CC-4823-8812-AD215DD9778F/sleepstudy-report_1.mdl).\n\n2.  Open **sleepstudy-report\\_1.html** with your favorite browser.\n\n3.  Click on **Session 2**. The system consumes 1.818 Watts of energy during 19 hours and the **DRIPS %** is 92%.\n\n    ![](images/standbylab1.png)\n\n4.  Look at the **Top Offenders** table. The networking wireless device is listed as active 7% of the time during the session.\n\n    ![](images/standbylab2.png)\n\n5.  Click on the networking device row to obtain details about this offender.\n\n    ![](images/standbylab3.png)\n\nSpurious wakes are clearly identified by the report. There are 80 of them in this example. A follow-up discussion should happen with the IHV to determine why the wireless adapter is waking up the SoC unexpectedly. The underlying problem could be a bad device firmware implementation.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
