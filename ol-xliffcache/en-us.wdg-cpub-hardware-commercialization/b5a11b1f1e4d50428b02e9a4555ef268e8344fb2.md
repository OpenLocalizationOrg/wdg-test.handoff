# Where is DISM?


Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows® image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) image. For more information about DISM see [What is DISM?](what-is-dism.md)

To get DISM, download and install the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK), see [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) Technical Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526740).

DISM appears in the Windows ADK here: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\<version>\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\<arch>\DISM`

where &lt;version&gt; can be **8.0**, **8.1**, or **10**, and &lt;arch&gt; can be **x86** or **amd64**.
