Windows mobile development\n\n\nHere's what you'll need to start customizing, testing, and deploying Windows on mobile devices.\n\n## <span id=\"meet_all_the_prerequisites\"></span><span id=\"MEET_ALL_THE_PREREQUISITES\"></span>Step 1: Meet all the prerequisites\n\n\nBefore you can get started on your Windows mobile development, make sure you meet these requirements:\n\n-   You have access to the Microsoft Connect site where mobile partners can download the latest mobile OS kits and packages.\n\n    If you don't have access or need more information, contact your Microsoft representative.\n\n-   A development workstation or technician computer\n\n    This PC will run the tools needed during the development process. The PC must be running one of the following operating systems:\n\n    -   Windows 10 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64)\n    -   Windows 8.1 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64)\n    -   Windows 7 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64)\n\n    You must install all Windows critical updates to avoid any issues when using the mobile kits.\n\n-   Uninstall earlier versions of the tools and kits\n\n    If you are using a different version of the tools and kits other than the ones listed in the *Pairing information* section of the kit release notes, you first need to uninstall all of the programs associated with these components.\n\n-   Download the kits and OS packages\n\n    Download the latest kits and tools for Windows 10 Mobile from the Microsoft Connect site. See Contents of the mobile build to learn more about the contents of the MobileOS kit for different silicon architectures.\n\n-   Reference mobile hardware\n\n    This mobile device should represent all the mobile devices in a single model line; for example, the Contoso Windows Phone. For more information about detailed hardware requirements for any device that runs Windows 10 Mobile, see *Section 2.0 - Minimum hardware requirements for Windows 10 Mobile* in [Minimum hardware requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915086).\n\n-   Board support package (BSP) prerequisites\n\n    Make sure you have all the necessary BSP files for your reference hardware. A BSP is a set of files and drivers that Windows 10 Mobile uses to communicate with the hardware on the device, to launch the OS, and to create an OS image that can run on your reference hardware. The SoC vendor provides the BSP for your reference hardware.\n\n## <span id=\"install_the_tools_and_development_kits\"></span><span id=\"INSTALL_THE_TOOLS_AND_DEVELOPMENT_KITS\"></span>Step 2: Install the tools and development kits\n\n\nThe following kits and tools are used for Windows mobile development:\n\n-   Visual Studio 2015, which is your primary development environment for writing apps and drivers.\n\n-   Windows 10 Mobile OS, which is contained in the MobileOS package.\n\n-   Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), which contains the tools you can use for building and customizing your image as well as several other deployment tools that you can use to help you automate a large-scale deployment of Windows.\n\n-   Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and Windows 10 Standalone SDK, which you can install separately or install the Enterprise WDK (EWDK), which contains a version of the driver kit and SDK.\n\n-   Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK), which is a test framework you can use to test hardware devices for Windows.\n\nThe following table specifies which development scenarios require each of the kits and tools.\n\n| Development scenario                                                                   | MobileOS kit | Windows ADK  | Windows Standalone SDK | WDK          | Visual Studio 2015 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Compile code that runs on the mobile device (for example, drivers, services, and apps) | Required     | Required     | Required               | Required     | Required           |\n| Build packages                                                                         | Not required | Required     | Not required           | Not required | Not required       |\n| Sign binaries and packages                                                             | Not required | Required     | Not required           | Not required | Not required       |\n| Build and customize mobile images on the command line using ImgGen                     | Required     | Not required | Required               | Required     | Not required       |\n| Build and customize mobile images using Windows ICD                                    | Required     | Required     | Not required           | Not required | Not required       |\n\n \n\n**To install the kits and tools**\n\n1.
