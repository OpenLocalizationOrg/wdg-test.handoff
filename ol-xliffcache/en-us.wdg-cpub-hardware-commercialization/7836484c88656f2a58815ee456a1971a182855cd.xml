A configuration set is a portable collection of files and folders that you can place on a USB Flash Drive (UFD) or on a network share.\n\nTo use a configuration set, you need the following:\n\n-   A configuration set. For more information, see [Create a Configuration Set](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915081).\n\n-   A Windows product DVD.\n\n-   A removable media, such as a USB flash drive (UFD), if you intend to install without a network.\n\n-   A bootable Windows PE media if you intend to install from a network. For more information, see [WinPE: Create USB Bootable drive](winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive.md).\n\n**How to use a Configuration Set with a Windows DVD**\n\n1.  Turn on the computer.\n\n2.  Insert both the removable media that contains your configuration set and the Windows product DVD into the new computer.\n\n    **Note**  \n    When using a USB flash drive, insert the drive directly into the primary set of USB ports for the computer. For a desktop computer, this is typically in the back of the computer.\n\n     \n\n3.  Restart the computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.\n\n4.  When the computer reboots, you might be prompted to press any key to boot from the CD-ROM drive. Press any key and Windows Setup (**Setup.exe**) starts automatically.\n\n    By default, Windows Setup searches all removable media for an answer file that is named **Autounattend.xml**. Autounattend.xml must be located at the root of the removable media.\n\n    Installation starts, and the settings you configured in your answer file will be applied.\n\n**How to use a Configuration Set from a Network**\n\n1.  Create two folders on a network share to store the product DVD source files and your configuration set. For example,\n\n    ``` syntax\n    net use N: \\\\server\\share\n    md N:\\WindowsDVD\n    md N:\\ConfigurationSets\n    ```\n\n2.  Copy the content of the product DVD to the **\\\\WindowsDVD** folder.\n\n3.  Copy your configuration set to the **\\\\ConfigurationSets** folder.\n\n4.  Boot the destination computer by using a bootable Windows PE media.\n\n    For information about creating bootable Windows PE media, see [WinPE: Create USB Bootable drive](winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive.md).\n\n5.  At a command prompt in Windows PE, map a network drive to your network share. For example,\n\n    ``` syntax\n    net use N: \\\\server\\share\n    ```\n\n6.  Run Windows Setup from the network and reference your answer file in your configuration set. For example,\n\n    ``` syntax\n    N:\\WindowsDVD\\setup /unattend:N:\\ConfigurationSets\\autounattend.xml\n    ```\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[Windows Setup Technical Reference](windows-setup-technical-reference.md)\n\n[Add a Custom Command to an Answer File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915058)\n\n[Boot from a DVD](boot-from-a-dvd.md)\n\n[Deploy a Custom Image](deploy-a-custom-image.md)\n\n[Boot Windows to Audit Mode or OOBE](boot-windows-to-audit-mode-or-oobe.md)\n\n[Add Device Drivers to Windows During Windows Setup](add-device-drivers-to-windows-during-windows-setup.md)\n\n[Add a Custom Script to Windows Setup](add-a-custom-script-to-windows-setup.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
