In an XML editor, create a new XML file.\n\n2.  Enter collector definitions. For more information, see [1. Collector Definitions](1-collector-definitions.md).\n\n3.  Enter system and event provider definitions. For more information, see [2. System and Event Provider Definitions](2-system-and-event-provider-definitions.md).\n\n4.  Enter profile definitions. For more information, see [3. Profile Definitions](3-profile-definitions.md).\n\n    **Note**  \n    If you want the custom profile to stop and roll back if some providers do not start, set the **Strict** attribute to \"true\". For more information about this option, see [Strict Providers](strict-providers.md).\n\n     \n\n5.  Save the file with a .wprp extension.\n\nYou can define derived collectors, providers, and profiles that inherit from a base version that you define earlier in the same file or in another file.
