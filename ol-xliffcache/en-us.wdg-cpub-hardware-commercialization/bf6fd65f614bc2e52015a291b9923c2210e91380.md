# Detail Level


Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) recording profiles control all aspects of a recording. For each WPR profile, you must select a detail level. The available levels are **Light** and **Verbose**. The **Light** detail level is primarily used for timing recordings. The **Verbose** detail level provides the detailed information that you need for analysis. Built-in profiles support both **Verbose** and **Light** detail levels.

The **Verbose** level is selected by default in both the WPR user interface (UI) and in the WPR command line.

When you author custom profiles, we recommend that you define both a light version and a verbose version in the same .wprp file. These files can contain up to four profile definitions: one for each combination of detail level and logging mode.
