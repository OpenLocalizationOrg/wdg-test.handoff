deploying devices:\n\n## <span id=\"pc\"></span><span id=\"PC\"></span>PCs\n\n\nHere's how we'll refer to them:\n\n-   **Technician PC**: Your work PC. This PC should have at least 15GB of free space for installing the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526803) and for modifying Windows images. We recommend either Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 with the latest updates. The minimum requirement is Windows 7 SP1, though this may require additional tools or workarounds for tasks such as mounting .ISO images.\n-   **Reference device**: A test PC or tablet that represents all of the devices in a single model line; for example, the *Fabrikam Notebook PC Series 1*. This device must meet the Windows 10 minimum hardware requirements.\n\n    You'll reformat this device as part of the walkthrough.\n\n## <span id=\"hw\"></span><span id=\"HW\"></span>Storage\n\n\n-   A USB key that's at least 8GB and can be formatted. It should not be a Windows-to-Go key or a key marked as a non-removable drive.\n-   A second USB key or an external USB hard drive for storing files. Minimum free space: 8GB, using NTFS, ExFAT, or any other file system that allows files over 4GB.\n\nWhen possible, use USB 3.0 keys/drives in USB 3.0 ports to speed up file copy procedures. Some USB 3.0 keys may not work with some USB 2.0 ports.\n\n## <span id=\"sw\"></span><span id=\"SW\"></span>Software\n\n\nCopy the following source files to the technician PC, rather than using external sources like network shares or removable drives. This reduces the risk of interrupting the build process from a temporary network issue or from disconnecting the USB device.\n\n-   The latest Windows 10 image. Mount the ISO file to a drive, and note the drive letter, for example, D.\n\n    This lab assumes the 64-bit architecture, so if you’re using the 32-bit version, change all mentions of x64 to x86.\n\n-   Copy the D:\\\\sources\\\\install.wim file, and save it to the local drive, in the folder: **C:\\\\Images\\\\Win10\\_x64\\\\**.\n-   The Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10 with a matching build number as the Windows 10 image.\n-   Language packs with a matching build number and architecture as the Windows 10 image. Save the files using the folder structure: C:\\\\Languages\\\\fr-fr x64\\\\lp.cab.\n-   Language components (Features on Demand) with a matching build number and architecture as the Windows 10 image. Save the files in the same folder as the main language pack:\n    -   C:\\\\Languages\\\\fr-fr x64\\\\Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-Basic-fr-fr-Package.cab\n    -   C:\\\\Languages\\\\fr-fr x64\\\\Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-TextToSpeech-fr-fr-Package.cab\n    -   C:\\\\Languages\\\\fr-fr x64\\\\Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-Speech-fr-fr-Package.cab\n-   Optional: Test product keys or distribution product keys that match the Windows 10 image. Note: we don’t cover adding the product keys in this lab.\n-   Get any drivers, and packages that you’ll need for these devices.\n-   Download a Windows app.\n-   Optional: [Download the sample scripts, drivers, and packages](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528668) that go along with this lab.\n\n**Important**  The Windows ADK for Windows 10, language packs, and Feature-On-Demand (FOD) files must all be from the same build with a matching build number. The FODs must also match the architecture of the install.wim.\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"prepare\"></span><span id=\"PREPARE\"></span>Prepare your technician PC\n\n\nHere’s how to set up your PC for either Lab 1 or Lab 2.\n\n**Copy the Windows image to the local drive**\n\n1.  Mount the Windows ISO file that you downloaded (Right-click the file &gt; **Mount**), and note the drive letter, for example, D.\n2.  In File Explorer, create a new folder (example: **C:\\\\Images\\\\Win10\\_x64**), and copy the sources\\\\install.wim file into the folder. This will help speed file creation procedures later on.\n\n**Install the Windows ADK for Windows 10**\n\n1.  If you have a previous version of the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), uninstall it.\n2.  Download the version of the [Windows ADK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526803) that matches the version of Windows that you’re installing. **Run** the installer.\n3.  Click **Next** &gt; **Next** &gt; **Accept** to accept the defaults and to join the Customer Experience Improvement Program.\n4.  Select the following tools:\n\n    -   **Deployment Tools**\n    -   **Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE)**\n    -   **Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD)**\n    -   **User State Migration Tool (USMT)**\n\n    For these labs, you won't need the **Windows Performance Toolkit** or the **Windows Assessment Toolkit**. You can clear those check boxes.\n\n5.  Click **Install**, and then click **Yes** to confirm. This may take a few minutes.\n6.  When the installation is finished, click **Close**.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
