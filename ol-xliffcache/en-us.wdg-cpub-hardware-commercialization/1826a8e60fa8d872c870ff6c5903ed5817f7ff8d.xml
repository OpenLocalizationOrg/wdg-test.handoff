The VHD can then be copied to one or more systems either to run in a virtual machine or for native boot.\n\nFor more information, see [Download and install Windows PE (WinPE) so you can boot from a USB flash drive or an external USB hard drive](download-and-install-windows-pe--winpe--so-you-can-boot-from-a-usb-flash-drive-or-an-external-usb-hard-drive.md).\n\nOn first native boot, the *specialize* configuration pass runs and computer-specific information is applied to the Windows operating system on the VHD. The instance of the VHD cannot be copied onto another system or run in a virtual machine after the specialize configuration pass is completed. The original VHD that has a Windows image can continue to be copied and deployed to multiple computers, if the image has already been prepared for installation using the Sysprep tool with the **/specialize** option. You can also use an answer file to prepare the image for installation by using the Microsoft-Windows-Deployment | Generalize setting. For more information about the **specialize** and **generalize** configuration passes, see [Windows Setup Configuration Passes](windows-setup-configuration-passes.md). For more information about how to use the Generalize setting in an answer file, see the Windows® Unattended Setup Reference.\n\nThe Windows Deployment Server role supports deployment of VHD image files in addition to .wim files. Windows Deployment Server automates the network deployment of VHD images for native-boot usage. Windows Deployment Server can be used to copy the VHD image to a local partition, and to configure the local Boot Configuration Data (BCD) for native boot from the VHD.\n\n## <span id=\"In_This_Section\"></span><span id=\"in_this_section\"></span><span id=\"IN_THIS_SECTION\"></span>In This Section\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Understanding Virtual Hard Disks with Native Boot](understanding-virtual-hard-disks-with-native-boot.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Includes common scenarios, requirements, and recommendations for installing Windows to a VHD with native boot.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Boot to VHD (Native Boot): Add a Virtual Hard Disk to the Boot Menu](boot-to-vhd--native-boot--add-a-virtual-hard-disk-to-the-boot-menu.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Create and deploy a VHD on a destination computer.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Download and install Windows PE (WinPE) so you can boot from a USB flash drive or an external USB hard drive](download-and-install-windows-pe--winpe--so-you-can-boot-from-a-usb-flash-drive-or-an-external-usb-hard-drive.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Update a computer that has a Windows 7 or Windows 8 boot environment and add a VHD to the BCD configuration.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[BCDboot Command-Line Options](bcdboot-command-line-options-techref-di.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
