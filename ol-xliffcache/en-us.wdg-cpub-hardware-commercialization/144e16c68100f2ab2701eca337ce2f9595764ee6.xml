For more info about setting the Mobile Operator ID and Device ID when creating an update request, see [New-RequestForUpdate cmdlet](new-requestforupdate-cmdlet.md).\n\n-   For all packages, OEMs must set the required attribute values.

The package numbers must use a hierarchical scheme from left to right, such that version 2.0.0.0 is greater than version 1.9.9.9.\n\nWe recommend using the silicon vendor (SV) version number, followed by the OEM version number. Example: *SV-Major.SV-Minor.OEM-Major.OEM-Minor*. For consistency, consider using build environment variables such as the date when creating your versioning scheme.\n\nWith each new update, create a new version number. Provide both the old and new version number when submitting the update. For example:\n\n1.  0001.0001.0001.20140801 -&gt; 0001.0040.0055.20140808\n\n2.  0001.0040.0055.20140808 -&gt; 0001.0040.0077.20140815\n\n3.  0001.0040.0077.20140815 -&gt; 0002.0000.0077.20140822\n\nFailure to meet this requirement leads to either ignored packages during update generation (for the packages where the version does not increase) or a complete failure in the update generation processes.\n\n**To prevent versioning errors:**\n\n-   Keep track of the version numbers in a separate spreadsheet.\n\n-   Don't send two versions of the same package with the same previous version number - each update must be chained together to the previous version. The device update publishing service reserves the right to reject requests for updates (RFUs) that do not include the target version of the previous update as the source version of the new update.\n\n**Versioning FAQ**\n\n*What happens if I don't change my version number and the contents of my package changes?*\n\nThe package will be considered to be the same as the existing version, and it will not be downloaded and installed when users update their device\n\n*Should I use the same version numbers across all my packages?*\n\nSome versions may be different if they accurately indicate a previous package version will be used. You should be consistent with the versioning scheme that is used, for example in how versions numbers are incremented and what each element in the four part version number represents.\n\n*Should all of the drivers' versions match the packages' versions for each update?*\n\nIt is recommended to have the drivers' package version numbers follow a similar versioning scheme as much as possible, but it is not a requirement that all versions of all of the packages be identical. Any package to be updated must have an incremented version number.\n\n## <span id=\"Update_partition_requirements\"></span><span id=\"update_partition_requirements\"></span><span id=\"UPDATE_PARTITION_REQUIREMENTS\"></span>Update partition requirements\n\n\n**Warning**  \nAll user data and settings are preserved when updates are installed to the device.
