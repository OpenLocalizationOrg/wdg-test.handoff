Services\n\n\nThere are three ways to set up jobs and associated assets. You can set up a job to perform the following:\n\n-   Assess computers that already have a supported, running operating system.\n\n-   Deploy a supported operating system to a computer by using Windows Assessment Services, and then assess the computer.\n\n-   Use other deployment tools or methods to deploy a supported operating system to a computer, and then assess the computer.\n\nThis topic describes all three of these deployment options.\n\n**To add assets to a job and deploy an image**\n\n1.  In the Windows ASC, create or open a job.\n\n2.  Under **Job settings**, click **Overview**, and verify that the **Apply image** check box is selected.\n\n3.  If you want to inject matching Plug and Play drivers from a Dynamic Driver Provisioning driver store during image deployment, select **Dynamic Driver Provisioning**.\n\n4.  Under **Job settings**, click **Assets**, and then click **Add** to select the computers that you want run the job on.\n\n5.  In the **Select Evaluation Assets** window, select the computers that you want to assess, click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.\n\n6.  The computers appear on the right side of the Windows ASC under **Evaluation assets**. Select a computer, click **Change Image**, select the image that you want to apply to that computer, and then click **OK**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The computer and the image architecture must match, except that you can select an x86-based image to deploy to an x64-based computer.\n\n     \n\n**To add assets to a job and use custom deployment**\n\n1.  In the Windows ASC, create or open a job.\n\n2.  Under **Job settings**, click **Overview**, and verify that the **Apply image** check box is selected.\n\n3.  Clear the **Dynamic Driver Provisioning** check box.\n\n4.  Under **Job settings**, click **Assets**, and then click **Add** to select the computers that you want run the job on.\n\n5.  In the **Select Evaluation Assets** window, select the computers that you want to assess, and then click **Next**.\n\n6.  Click **&lt;Use Predeployed Image&gt;**, and then click **Finish**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    When you schedule a job by using **&lt;Use Predeployed Image&gt;**, the job does not start until you deploy Windows and run **\\\\\\\\%WASServer%\\\\relax\\\\scripts\\\\testmachine\\\\completedeployment.cmd AUTO** at an elevated command prompt.\n\n     \n\n**To add assets to a job without deploying an image**\n\n1.  In the Windows ASC, create or open a job.\n\n2.  Under **Job settings**, click **Overview**, and then clear the **Apply image** check box.\n\n3.  Under **Job settings**, click **Assets**, and then click **Add** to select the computers that you want run the job on.\n\n4.  In the **Select Evaluation Assets** window, select the computers that you want to assess, and then click **Finish**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Windows Assessment Services common scenarios](windows-assessment-services-how-to-topics--wastechref.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
