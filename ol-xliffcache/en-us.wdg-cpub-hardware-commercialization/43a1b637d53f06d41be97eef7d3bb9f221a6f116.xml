Specification can be downloaded from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=523808).\n\n## <span id=\"_Prerequisites\"></span><span id=\"_prerequisites\"></span><span id=\"_PREREQUISITES\"></span> Prerequisites\n\n\n-   For each EFI System Resource Table (ESRT) entry, you need a capsule for the latest firmware version. The scenarios will refer to the latest version as X. Each ESRT entry is identified using a unique GUID.\n-   For each ESRT entry exposed, create a capsule package that its version is incremented above the package created in step 1. These capsules will be referred to as X+1.\n-   Capsules that aid in simulating failure conditions such as a capsule for which the payload is not signed or signed with an invalid PK.\n-   Make sure all capsules to be used are signed appropriately from the OS perspective, catalog signed, and firmware signed, PK signed. Unless, you are specifically testing the negative PK signing cases. See “Signing the Firmware driver Package” in the specification for details on how to sign a capsule or firmware driver package.\n\n## <span id=\"How_To\"></span><span id=\"how_to\"></span><span id=\"HOW_TO\"></span>How To\n\n\n**Install a new capsule or reinstall a previously installed capsule**\n\n1.  Open up device manager.\n2.  Find the device node that represents your firmware, it is usually under the “Firmware” devices.\n3.  Right click on the firmware device you wish to update.\n4.  Select **Update driver software**. You will get a popup that states “Update Driver Software - &lt;Firmware&gt;”.\n5.  Select **Browse my computer for driver software**.\n6.  On the next window, select **Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer**.\n7.  If the driver has been installed before, select it from the **Show compatible hardware** box. If it does not exist, select **Have disk** and continue on. Otherwise, select **OK** and reboot the system.\n8.  If you select **Have Disk**, you will get a popup labeled **Install From Disk**.\n9.  Use **Browse** to go to the directory that has the capsule of the firmware you wish to install.\n10. Select the INF file in that directory and hit **OK** to install.\n11. During installation, if you get a popup saying the driver is not signed, go ahead and accept this driver.\n12. The system asks you to reboot.\n13. After you installed the capsule for the firmware, you need to reboot. If you wish to install multiple capsule packages, then wait to reboot until all capsules are installed and then reboot on the final capsule.\n\n**Query the version and status details:**\n\n-   Run the QueryVersionAndStatus.ps1 PowerShell (PS) script to query the current firmware version, last attempt firmware version and last attempt status.\n\n    **To run the script:**\n\n    1.  Run PowerShell as administrator.\n    2.  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted –Force` (This only has to be done once.)\n    3.  Display the version and status details for the given GUID. For example: `.\\QueryVersionAndStatus.ps1 6bd2efb9-23ab-4b4c-bc37-016517413e9a`\n    4.  Check if firmware update was successful: Refer to the section “Validating the status of the firmware update” in the specification document. Make sure that the Last Attempt Status and the Current Version matches the expected version.\n    5.  Recommended: Check to make sure that the devices you are updating are also still functioning.\n    6.  Set the rollback policy: Some of the scenarios might require rolling back firmware. Rollback is not a production scenario. In order to be able to rollback, a registry policy key has to be created. Create a REG\\_DWORD key with the name “Policy” under the node HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\FirmwareResources\\\\{&lt;GUID&gt;} and set the value of the Policy key to 1. Note that the GUID should be replaced with the actual GUID from the ESRT.\n\n## <span id=\"Scenarios\"></span><span id=\"scenarios\"></span><span id=\"SCENARIOS\"></span>Scenarios\n\n\n### <span id=\"S1__Each_ESRT_entry_is_successfully_updatable_through_capsule\"></span><span id=\"s1__each_esrt_entry_is_successfully_updatable_through_capsule\"></span><span id=\"S1__EACH_ESRT_ENTRY_IS_SUCCESSFULLY_UPDATABLE_THROUGH_CAPSULE\"></span>S1: Each ESRT entry is successfully updatable through capsule\n\nThe following steps should be completed for each ESRT entry that is supported by the platform. Or in other words, for System firmware and each device firmware that supports updating firmware through UpdateCapsule.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1.  For each ESRT entry, install the capsule for firmware version X.\n2.  Make sure all the above capsules are installed, prior to rebooting.\n\n**Expected Result**\n\nFirmware update should be successful for each ESRT entry that was updated. For all ESRT entries, for which the update was attempted, validate that:\n\n-   Current Firmware Version = X\n-   Last Attempt Version = X\n-   Last Attempt Status = 0 (STATUS\\_SUCCESS)\n\n### <span id=\"S2__The_latest_firmware_version_X_is_also_updatable_to_X_1_\"></span><span id=\"s2__the_latest_firmware_version_x_is_also_updatable_to_x_1_\"></span><span id=\"S2__THE_LATEST_FIRMWARE_VERSION_X_IS_ALSO_UPDATABLE_TO_X_1_\"></span>S2: The latest firmware version X is also updatable to X+1\n\nThe following steps should be completed for each ESRT entry that is supported by the platform.
