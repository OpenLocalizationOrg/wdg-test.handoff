The best technical expertise regarding manufacturing resides within those who built the OEM manufacturing line. This means that the OEM will need to determine which flashing and manufacturing process will work best for them. OEM service centers may have unique needs that will also influence the selection of flashing tools. The OEM will need to determine how to test and validate that the selected tools and processes meets their cost, quality, and other unique manufacturing objectives.\n\nThe OEM uses the Microsoft supplied imaging tools to create the FFU OS images that are flashed to the device.\n\n## <span id=\"Flashing_tools_comparison\"></span><span id=\"flashing_tools_comparison\"></span><span id=\"FLASHING_TOOLS_COMPARISON\"></span>Flashing tools comparison\n\n\nThe OEM may need to develop a custom flashing tool to address the life cycle needs of the device.

The OEM can use their unique flashing tools as well as gang programmer technologies to manufacture the device if they find that those options are more suitable to their environment.\n\nIf the OEM uses a gang programmer they will need to develop a custom tool to convert the FFU image to a raw binary image. The conversion tool will need to:\n\n1.  Open a raw binary file in the format expected by the gang programmer.\n\n2.  Read in the FFU file and parse the file data as specified in [FFU image format](ffu-image-format.md).\n\n3.
