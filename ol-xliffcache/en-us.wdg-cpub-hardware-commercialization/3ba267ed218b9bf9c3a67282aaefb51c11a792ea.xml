The assessment measures the time to fully render a new Internet Explorer window on the desktop, with a single tab and simple content. This measurement includes the load time of the IExplore.exe process and the frame-creation and tab-creation intervals. The assessment also measures the performance of extensions that are loaded and initialized during startup. It doesn't measure network or browsing performance. For more information about results and issues that this assessment produces, see [Results for the Internet Explorer Startup Performance Assessment](results-for-the-internet-explorer-startup-performance-assessment.md).\n\nThe assessment follows this workflow:\n\n1.  Creates a custom local page that notifies you that the assessment is running and instructs you not to interact with the computer\n\n2.  Prepares for tracing and metric collection\n\n3.  Starts Internet Explorer and starts to collect metrics\n\n**Note**  \nThe assessment launches Internet Explorer 4 times. The first time is a training iteration, and the next 3 are timing iterations. The training iteration ensures that the timing iterations load from the system cache and not a cold start. The results that are produced are aggregate results from the timing iterations. You can change the number of timing iterations in the assessment settings.\n\n \n\nThe following graphic illustrates the assessment process.\n\n![workflow for internet explorer startup performance](images/dep-win8-8-techref-ielaunchflow.jpg)\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [System Requirements](#sysrqrmts)\n\n-   [Settings](#assesssettings)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"sysrqrmts\"></a>System Requirements\n\n\nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\nRun this assessment only while the desktop is full screen. Do not run this assessment if you have another Windows Store app opened side-by-side with the desktop.\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems.\n\nThere are two ways to run this assessment on Windows RT:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows Assessment Console and then run it on Windows RT. For more information, see [Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services to run assessments on Windows RT.
