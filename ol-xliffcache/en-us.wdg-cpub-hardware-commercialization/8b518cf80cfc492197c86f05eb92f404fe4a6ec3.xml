Windows Defender is a Microsoft速 application that can help to prevent, remove, and quarantine malware and spyware.\n\nBy default, Windows Defender performs a scan of each file on the computer when the computer accesses the file for the first time. This is known as an on-access scan. Optimization mechanisms, such as caching, help reduce unnecessary scans of files that have already been scanned. When Windows Defender performs a quick scan or a full scan (also known as on-demand scans), the rest of the files on the system will be marked as safe.\n\n**Note**  \nIf you have already deployed a series of computers, and then later determine that there is a potential problem with the security of the image, contact your Depth Project Manager (PM) within the Windows Ecosystem Engagement team. and provide the unique identifier of the image. Microsoft will add this unique identifier into Windows Update. After a computer with that unique identifier receives updates from Windows Update, Windows Defender performs scans on all of the files on that computer.\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"Adding_a_Trusted_Image_Identifier\"></span><span id=\"adding_a_trusted_image_identifier\"></span><span id=\"ADDING_A_TRUSTED_IMAGE_IDENTIFIER\"></span>Adding a Trusted Image Identifier\n\n\nFor optimal performance, we recommend that you add this setting when you prepare the computer for final deployment, after you perform a full scan of the final image.\n\n**To add a trusted image identifier**\n\n1.  Create an answer file that you are going to use with Sysprep, and add the Security-Malware-Windows-Defender\\\\`TrustedImageIdentifier` setting. For more information, see [Use Answer Files with Sysprep](use-answer-files-with-sysprep.md).\n\n2.  For the value of the `TrustedImageIdentifier` setting, specify a unique identifier, such as a GUID, for the image.\n\n3.  Install Windows on the reference computer, and perform all updates that are described in the \"Common Sysprep Scenarios\" section of the [Sysprep (System Preparation) Overview](sysprep--system-preparation--overview.md) topic.\n\n4.  Perform a scan of the image by using Windows Defender or another scanning tool. This can help make sure that the image is safe.\n\n5.  When you run Sysprep for the final time, use the Sysprep command together with the /oobe and /unattend options, as follows:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Sysprep /oobe /shutdown /unattend:Unattend.xml\n    ```\n\n6.  Perform other offline tasks, such as offline servicing of the image. Capture and apply the image to other computers, and then deliver the computer to the customer.\n\n    The next time that the computer starts, Windows identifies all of the files currently on the system, and skips these files during subsequent scans.\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[Sysprep Process Overview](sysprep-process-overview.md)\n\n[Use Answer Files with Sysprep](use-answer-files-with-sysprep.md#bkmk-1)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
