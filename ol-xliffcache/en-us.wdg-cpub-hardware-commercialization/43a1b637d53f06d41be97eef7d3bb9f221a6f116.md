# Validating Windows UEFI Firmware Update Platform Functionality


This document lists the basic validation scenarios that are required to pass before signing-off on the Windows UEFI Firmware Update Platform functionality. Specification can be downloaded from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=523808).

## <span id="_Prerequisites"></span><span id="_prerequisites"></span><span id="_PREREQUISITES"></span> Prerequisites


-   For each EFI System Resource Table (ESRT) entry, you need a capsule for the latest firmware version. The scenarios will refer to the latest version as X. Each ESRT entry is identified using a unique GUID.
-   For each ESRT entry exposed, create a capsule package that its version is incremented above the package created in step 1. These capsules will be referred to as X+1.
-   Capsules that aid in simulating failure conditions such as a capsule for which the payload is not signed or signed with an invalid PK.
-   Make sure all capsules to be used are signed appropriately from the OS perspective, catalog signed, and firmware signed, PK signed. Unless, you are specifically testing the negative PK signing cases. See “Signing the Firmware driver Package” in the specification for details on how to sign a capsule or firmware driver package.

## <span id="How_To"></span><span id="how_to"></span><span id="HOW_TO"></span>How To


**Install a new capsule or reinstall a previously installed capsule**

1.  Open up device manager.
2.  Find the device node that represents your firmware, it is usually under the “Firmware” devices.
3.  Right click on the firmware device you wish to update.
4.  Select **Update driver software**. You will get a popup that states “Update Driver Software - &lt;Firmware&gt;”.
5.  Select **Browse my computer for driver software**.
6.  On the next window, select **Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer**.
7.  If the driver has been installed before, select it from the **Show compatible hardware** box. If it does not exist, select **Have disk** and continue on. Otherwise, select **OK** and reboot the system.
8.  If you select **Have Disk**, you will get a popup labeled **Install From Disk**.
9.  Use **Browse** to go to the directory that has the capsule of the firmware you wish to install.
10. Select the INF file in that directory and hit **OK** to install.
11. During installation, if you get a popup saying the driver is not signed, go ahead and accept this driver.
12. The system asks you to reboot.
13. After you installed the capsule for the firmware, you need to reboot. If you wish to install multiple capsule packages, then wait to reboot until all capsules are installed and then reboot on the final capsule.

**Query the version and status details:**

-   Run the QueryVersionAndStatus.ps1 PowerShell (PS) script to query the current firmware version, last attempt firmware version and last attempt status.

    **To run the script:**

    1.  Run PowerShell as administrator.
    2.  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted –Force` (This only has to be done once.)
    3.  Display the version and status details for the given GUID. For example: `.\QueryVersionAndStatus.ps1 6bd2efb9-23ab-4b4c-bc37-016517413e9a`
    4.  Check if firmware update was successful: Refer to the section “Validating the status of the firmware update” in the specification document. Make sure that the Last Attempt Status and the Current Version matches the expected version.
    5.  Recommended: Check to make sure that the devices you are updating are also still functioning.
    6.  Set the rollback policy: Some of the scenarios might require rolling back firmware. Rollback is not a production scenario. In order to be able to rollback, a registry policy key has to be created. Create a REG\_DWORD key with the name “Policy” under the node HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FirmwareResources\\{&lt;GUID&gt;} and set the value of the Policy key to 1. Note that the GUID should be replaced with the actual GUID from the ESRT.

The following steps should also be carried out for other device firmware (lower priority).

**Steps**

1.  For UEFI System Firmware, create a capsule X+1 such that the “LowestSupportedFirmwareVersion” in the ESRT entry for the system firmware is set to X+1.
2.  Install the capsule X+1 and make sure that the update succeeds.
3.  Create a UEFI System firmware update capsules, such that the version in the INF is X+2 but the actual firmware binary file is of version X.
4.  Install the capsule X+2 and reboot the system.

**Expected Result**

Firmware update should fail. For ESRT entry corresponding to the System Firmware, validate that:

-   Current Firmware Version = X+1
-   Last Attempt Version = X+2
-   Last Attempt Status = 0xC0000059 (STATUS\_REVISION\_MISMATCH)

### <span id="S4__Seamless_recovery_and_firmware_update__if_implemented__"></span><span id="s4__seamless_recovery_and_firmware_update__if_implemented__"></span><span id="S4__SEAMLESS_RECOVERY_AND_FIRMWARE_UPDATE__IF_IMPLEMENTED__"></span>S4: Seamless recovery and firmware update (if implemented)

This scenario varies from platform to platform depending on the implementation of the seamless recovery. Based on the implementation, the validation might require creating bad capsules that forces the system into recovery or disconnecting the power in the middle of an update or through any other means of exercising the recovery flows.

**Expected Result**

The system should boot into the OS and the firmware update should be marked as failed. The version reported by the UEFI firmware resource device should not have changed.
