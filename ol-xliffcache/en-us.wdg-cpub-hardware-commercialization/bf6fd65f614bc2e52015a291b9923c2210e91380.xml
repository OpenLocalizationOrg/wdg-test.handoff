For each WPR profile, you must select a detail level. The available levels are **Light** and **Verbose**. The **Light** detail level is primarily used for timing recordings. The **Verbose** detail level provides the detailed information that you need for analysis. Built-in profiles support both **Verbose** and **Light** detail levels.\n\nThe **Verbose** level is selected by default in both the WPR user interface (UI) and in the WPR command line.\n\nWhen you author custom profiles, we recommend that you define both a light version and a verbose version in the same .wprp file. These files can contain up to four profile definitions: one for each combination of detail level and logging mode.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[WPR Features](wpr-features.md)\n\n[Logging Mode](logging-mode.md)\n\n[3.
