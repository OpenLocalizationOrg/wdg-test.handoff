You can use DISM image management commands to mount and get information about Windows image (.wim) files or virtual hard disks (VHD). You can also use DISM to capture, split, and otherwise manage .wim files.\n\nYou can use DISM to install, uninstall, configure, and update Windows features, packages, drivers, and international settings in a .wim file or VHD using the DISM servicing commands.\n\nDISM commands are used on offline images, but subsets of the DISM commands are also available for servicing a running operating system.\n\nDISM is installed with Windows, and it is also distributed in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK). DISM replaces several deployment tools, including PEimg, Intlcfg, ImageX, and Package Manager.\n\n## <span id=\"In_This_Section\"></span><span id=\"in_this_section\"></span><span id=\"IN_THIS_SECTION\"></span>In This Section\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[What is DISM?](what-is-dism.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Describes the DISM system requirements, benefits, common servicing and management scenarios, and limitations.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[DISM How-to Topics (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)](dism-how-to-topics--deployment-image-servicing-and-management.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Provides how-to instructions on using DISM.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[DISM Reference (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)](dism-reference--deployment-image-servicing-and-management.md)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Provides reference information for DISM, including command-line options, best practices, and supported platforms.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[Windows Setup Technical Reference](windows-setup-technical-reference.md)\n\n[Device Drivers and Deployment Overview](device-drivers-and-deployment-overview.md)\n\n[Language Packs (lp.cab) and Windows Deployment](language-packs--lpcab--and-windows-deployment.md)\n\n[Understanding Servicing Strategies](understanding-servicing-strategies.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
