# MMOS image definition


This section provides instructions for creating Windows 10 Mobile MMOS images. This process is similar to the process for creating the primary OS image.

## <span id="Creating_an_MMOS_image"></span><span id="creating_an_mmos_image"></span><span id="CREATING_AN_MMOS_IMAGE"></span>Creating an MMOS image


The MMOS image created during this process requires packages from the SoC manufacturer and the OEM in addition to those provided by Microsoft. The OEM packages that are included in the sample MfgOEMInput.xml configuration file are for illustration purposes only. OEMs should remove those example packages and replace them with their own OEM packages. It is up to the OEM to determine which set to include in MMOS. OEMs can add additional OEM packages containing test applications and test controllers, etc.

**Important**  
All the imaging and packaging tools are located in %WPDKCONTENTROOT%\\Tools\\bin\\i386. This path must be included in your environment Path for the tools to work. You must run these tools from a Visual Studio command-line window as an Administrator with access to MakeCat.exe in the environment path.

 

### <span id="Creating_OEM_packages"></span><span id="creating_oem_packages"></span><span id="CREATING_OEM_PACKAGES"></span>Creating OEM packages

Adding content to an image is done by creating your own packages. OEM packages can be added to an image by modifying the MfgOEMInput.xml file before creating an image with Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD).

For instructions on creating packages, see [Creating packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn756642).

### <span id="Specifying_features_in_MMOS"></span><span id="specifying_features_in_mmos"></span><span id="SPECIFYING_FEATURES_IN_MMOS"></span>Specifying features in MMOS

You can use the **Feature** element in the MfgOEMInput.xml file to include optional packages provided by Microsoft. You can modify the input XML file to support different features in MMOS for development, manufacturing, and retail service needs.

**Manufacturing development and debugging environment**

The following features are defined and supported in the manufacturing development and debugging environment. This environment can be used to create test applications for use in manufacturing.

**Important**  
The following features can only be used for test-signed packages and are not to be included in Customer Care WIM Images.

There are additional features that are defined in other image types of the operating system that are not supported in MMOS. This list is not exhaustive, but it provides examples of features that are not supported in the manufacturing or retail environments:

-   TESTINFRASTRUCTURE

-   IMGFAKELED

-   LABIMAGE

-   LOCATIONFRAMEWORKAPP

### <span id="Adding"></span><span id="adding"></span><span id="ADDING"></span>Configuring the MMOS MfgOEMInput.xml file

1.  Open the sample MfgOEMInput.xml file using a text editor. By default, this file is installed to %WPDKCONTENTROOT%\\OEMInputSamples\\8960Fluid.

2.  Add needed MMOS features as described previously.

3.  Add any required OEM packages to the file.

4.  Locate the **Product** element and confirm that it is set to "`Manufacturing OS`".

    You can optionally update the description to record information about the OS image.

    ``` syntax
    <Description>Manufacturing OS generation for ARM.fre</Description>
    <Product>Manufacturing OS</Product>
    ```

5.  Locate the **SOC** and **Device** elements and change them as necessary.

6.  Add %WPDKCONTENTROOT%\\Tools\\bin\\i386 to your environment **Path** variable.
