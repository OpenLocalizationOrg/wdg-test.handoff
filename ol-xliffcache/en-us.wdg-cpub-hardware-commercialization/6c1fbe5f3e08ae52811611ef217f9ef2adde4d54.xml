This allows you to share this package with other developers and replaces WPA sessions. A WPA package (\"trace package) captures the entire analysis session:\n\n-   Trace\n-   Tabs\n-   Graph configurations\n-   Filters\n-   Annotations\n-   Symbols\n    **Note**  Note WPA only packages symbols if they are loaded; if they are, WPA embeds them in the package.

If your trace has an issue and contains sensitive material and you send it to us for further investigation, make sure to protect any sensitive material as you would any trace. Due to zipping, the package will likely have a file size smaller compared to a trace; this does not mean the zipping process removed any sensitive information.\n\n     \n\n## Sharing a trace package\n\n\nTo create a profile, first configure your view layout as you want it to appear, and then do the following:\n\n1.  In the menu, choose File then Export Package. A Save As dialog opens.\n2.  Navigate to the desired location.\n3.  Name your export package, make sure the Save as type reads WPA Package (\\*.wpapk) and click Save. A Wpapk progress bar displays, indicating packaging process. You may close the window, as the process will continue running in the background until complete.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
