# Get the tools needed to customize Windows IoT Core


Here's the software you'll need to create OEM images using the WindowsÂ 10 IoT Core (IoT Core) ADK Add-Ons:

## <span id="PCs_and_devices"></span><span id="pcs_and_devices"></span><span id="PCS_AND_DEVICES"></span>PCs and devices


Here's how we'll refer to them:

-   **Technician PC**: Your work PC. This PC should have at least 15GB of free space for installing the software and for modifying IoT Core images.

    We recommend either Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 with the latest updates. The minimum requirement is Windows 7 SP1, though this may require additional tools or workarounds for tasks such as mounting .ISO images.

-   **IoT device**: A test device or board that represents all of the devices in a single model line.

    For our examples, you'll need a MinnowBoard Max or Raspberry Pi 2. These guides do not include sample files for the Qualcomm Dragonboard or the Raspberry Pi 3. To learn more, see [Windows compatible hardware development boards](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn914597).

-   An **HDMI cable**, and a **monitor or TV** with a dedicated HDMI input. We'll use this to verify that the image is loaded and that our sample apps are running.

## <span id="Storage"></span><span id="storage"></span><span id="STORAGE"></span>Storage


-   A **Micro SD card**. (Note, we just use this for our guide. You can build devices with other drives. Learn more about existing [supported storage](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/SupportedInterfaces.md#storage) options.)

    If your technician PC doesn't include a Micro SD slot, you may also need an adapter.

**Install the following tools on your technician PC**

1.  [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526803) including at least the **Deployment Tools** and **Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD)** features. You'll use these tools to create images and provisioning packages.
2.  [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](http://developer.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit)
3.  [IoT Core .iso package from MSDN Subscriber Downloads](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/downloads/#FileId=67415)  The .iso package adds the IoT Core packages and feature manifests used to create IoT Core images. To get these files, you'll need an MSDN subscription or an account as a registered Microsoft OEM. By default, these packages are installed to **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\MSPackages\\Retail**.
4.  [IoT Core ADK Add-Ons](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/)  Download the ZIP file on this page, and extract it to a folder, for example, **C:\\IoT-ADK-AddonKit**. This kit includes the sample scripts and base structures you'll use to create your image. (Want more detail? See [What's in the Windows ADK IoT Core Add-ons](iot-core-adk-addons.md)).
5.  [Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708576)

Other helpful software:

-   **A text editor such as Notepad++**. You can also use the Notepad tool, though for some files, you won't see the line breaks unless you open each file as a UTF-8 file.
-   **A compression program such as 7-Zip**, which can uncompress Windows app packages.

-   **An app built for IoT Core**. Our samples use the [Hello, World!](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532945) app, though you can use your own.
-   **A driver built for IoT Core**. Our samples use the [Hello, Blinky](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=780794) driver, though you can use your own.
