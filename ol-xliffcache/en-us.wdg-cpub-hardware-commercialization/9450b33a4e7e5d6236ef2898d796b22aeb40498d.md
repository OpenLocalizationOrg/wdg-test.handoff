# Language Packs (lp.cab)


To design PCs that work better for customers in different regions, you can set up Windows with the right set of local languages, settings, and keyboards or other input devices.

To help you reduce the size of your image, language packs have now been split into the following language components and [Features On Demand V2 (Capabilities)](features-on-demand-v2--capabilities.md):

-   UI Text (lp.cab)
-   Basic (spell check, typing)
-   Fonts
-   Handwriting
-   Optical character recognition
-   Text-to-speech
-   Speech

You can now choose to add only core language pack UI resources to your image, significantly reducing image size.

To preload Cortana features, add the following features on demand: UI text (lp.cab), the Basic, Text-to-Speech, and Speech language components. 

Not all components and features on demand are available for every language.

Language packs contain the text for the dialog boxes, menu items, and helpfiles that you see in Windows.

For some regions, language interface packs (LIPs) can provide additional translations for the most widely-used dialog boxes, menu items, and helpfile content. LIPs rely on a parent language pack to provide the remainder of the content.

When you include more than one language or a LIP to Windows, your customers will be able to choose the language that best meets their needs during Windows OOBE.

There's a few different ways to install language packs:

-   You can add a language pack to Windows by using the **Dism /Add-Package** tool. See [Add and Remove Language Packs on a Running Windows Installation](add-and-remove-language-packs-on-a-running-windows-installation.md) or [Add and Remove Language Packs Offline Using DISM](add-and-remove-language-packs-offline-using-dism.md).
-   To deploy a multilingual version of Windows by using Windows Setup (for example, a corporate image Windows DVD or a set of images available on a corporate network), you can add language resources to the installation program. See [Add Multilingual Support to a Windows Distribution](add-multilingual-support-to-a-windows-distribution.md).

    For corporate or network-based deployments, you may also need to update the Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) that users see when they choose how and where to install Windows to their PC. For more information, see [WinPE: Mount and Customize](winpe-mount-and-customize.md).

-   After Windows is installed, end users can download and install additional language packs and LIPs from the **Language** Control Panel. For more information, see the [Local Language Program](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=262343).

When things go wrong, the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) can help recover the system and data. When you update the available languages for Windows, update the available languages in the recovery tools: [Customize Windows RE](customize-windows-re.md).

Many apps include support for multiple languages, though some require separate installation of language packs to work properly. Consult with the app developer.

In general, install all of your languages onto Windows before installing apps. This helps make sure that the language resource files are available for each of the available apps.
