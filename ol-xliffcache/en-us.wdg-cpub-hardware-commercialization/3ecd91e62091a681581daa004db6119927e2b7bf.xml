When you install the toolkit, you get:\n\n-   **The Windows Assessment Console.** A GUI that you can use to group the assessments, create a job, run the job, and view and manage the job results. A job is a collection of one or more assessments, and their settings, that run together on a computer.\n\n-   **Assessments.** A combination of .xml and binary files that induce a specific set of states on a computer, measure and record the activity, and preserve the recorded results. The results often include diagnostics and remediation information that help you determine areas that need additional investigation and corrective action.\n\n-   **The Assessment Platform.** The infrastructure for developing and extending assessments, and for consistently running and displaying jobs, assessments, and results.\n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>[Assessment Platform Command-Line Syntax](assessment-platform-command-line-syntax.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>Learn how to use the AXE.exe command-line tool (installed with the Windows Assessment Toolkit) to automate jobs from a script and minimize resource usage.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>[Windows Assessment Console](windows-assessment-console.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>Learn how the Windows Assessment Console works, and how you can use it to configure and run assessments on a local computer.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>[Windows Assessment Services](windows-assessment-services-technical-reference.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>Learn how to use the Windows Assessment Services to automate running assessments; eliminate fragmented, error-prone, expensive pre-deployment processes; and replace multiple steps and tools with just one tool.</p>\n<p>Windows Assessment Services is included with the Windows ADK.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>[Windows Assessment Toolkit Technical Reference](windows-assessment-toolkit-technical-reference.md)</p></td>\n<td><p>View the assessments and the command-line syntax for the assessment platform.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
