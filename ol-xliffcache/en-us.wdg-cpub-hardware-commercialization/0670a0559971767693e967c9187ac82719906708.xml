This article describes the recording status.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"viewstat\"></a>\n\n\nWhen you start a recording by using the WPR user interface (UI), the recording status immediately displays on the WPR screen. If you start a recording by using the WPR command-line interface, you can view the recording status by using either of the following methods:\n\n-   In the command prompt window, type `wpr –status`. For more information about this command, see [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md#status).\n\n-   Open the WPR UI. The status of the recording that you started from the WPR command line will display.\n\nFor more information about how to use these methods to start a WPR recording, see [Start a Recording](start-a-recording.md) and [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md).\n\n**Note**  \nWPR can only display a recording’s status if the recording is started by WPR. It cannot display recording status for recordings that are started by Xperf or other applications.\n\n \n\nThe recording status displays the following information:\n\n-   **Recording Time**: This is the length of time that the recording has been running.\n\n-   **Buffer**: This is the buffer size that the recording is using. It is displayed in both MB and percentage of available pooled memory.\n\n-   **Events dropped**: The number of lost events since the recording was started. For more information about this issue, see [Avoid Lost Events](avoid-lost-events.md).\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Sessions](sessions.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
