You might want to collect traces without analysis in order to:\n\n-   Run analysis on a PC with more memory or a faster processor\n\n-   Delay analysis to free up time for other high priority uses of the machines\n\n-   Run on a PC that already has symbols configured\n\n-   Reanalyze assessment data later with updated diagnostic modules or symbols\n\n-   Collect the data on all devices, but analyze only those that meet specific criteria\n\n**To collect trace files without running analysis**\n\n1.  Select a job or assessment to run.\n\n2.  On the **Configure job** screen, select **Collect traces only**.\n\n3.  Run the job.\n\n4.  Trace files for the assessment will be saved to *%UserProfile%\\\\Documents\\\\Assessment Results*.\n\n    **Note**  \n    Collecting trace files without analysis is not available for all jobs and assessments.\n\n     \n\n## Run analysis on another device\n\n\nYou can load symbols on the PC where you want to analyze trace files. For more information, see [Symbol Support](../wpt/symbol-support.md).\n\n**To run analysis on trace files using WAC**\n\n1.  In the Windows Assessment Console, click **Options**, and then click **Open Results** to see all the job results that are available for viewing.\n\n2.  In the **Select Results** window, select the results that you want to analyze.\n\n3.  Click **Open** to open the results in details view.\n\n    The **Analysis complete** row of the results shows **False**.\n\n4.  Click **Analyze**.\n\n    If you have multiple results open that can be analyzed, you can select which ones to analyze.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Package a job and run it on another computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md)\n\n[Import results](import-results.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
