Use these procedures to remove the relevant settings and data from the NPS configuration.\n\n**To delete RADIUS clients from the NPS configuration**\n\n1.  Display the list of Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) clients on the NPS server. To do that, open an elevated command prompt, type this command, and then press Enter:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps show client\n    ```\n\n2.  Delete each RADIUS client in the list. To do that, at the elevated command prompt, type this command and then press Enter:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps delete client [name]\n    ```\n\n    For example, this command deletes a RADIUS client named *&lt;WirelessAP1&gt;* from the NPS server configuration:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps delete client name = <WirelessAP1>\n    ```\n\n    You can delete multiple RADIUS clients by inserting a comma between each client. For example:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps delete client name = <WirelessAP1>,<WirelessAP2>,<WirelessAP3>\n    ```\n\n    You can also remove a RADIUS client by using the following command.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Remove-NpsRadiusClient [-Name] <Radius Client Name>-\n    ```\n\n3.  Repeat this procedure for each RADIUS client that's configured on the NPS server.\n\n**To delete a remote RADIUS server group from the NPS server configuration**\n\n1.  Display the list of remote RADIUS server groups that are configured on the NPS server. To do that, open an elevated command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps show remoteservergroup\n    ```\n\n2.  Delete each remote server group in the list. To do that, at the elevated command prompt, type this command and then press Enter:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps delete remoteservergroup [name =] name\n    ```\n\n    For example, this command deletes a remote RADIUS server group named *&lt;RemoteServers1&gt;* from the NPS server configuration:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Netsh nps delete remoteservergroup name = <RemoteServers1>\n    ```\n\n    **Note**  \n    When you delete a remote RADIUS server group, all RADIUS servers that are contained in the group are deleted.\n\n     \n\n3.  Repeat this procedure for each remote RADIUS server group that's configured on the NPS server.\n\nYou can convert **Netsh** commands to Windows PowerShell® commands.
