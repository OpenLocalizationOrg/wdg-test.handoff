Build a base image for this design and test it. Next, customize Windows for that audience, include branding, logos, languages, and apps.\n\n## <span id=\"Device_types\"></span><span id=\"device_types\"></span><span id=\"DEVICE_TYPES\"></span>Device types\n\n\nConsider creating separate designs for different device types, such as low-cost or performance laptops, or low-cost or performance desktops. Each of these styles has different sets of critical differentiators, such as battery life or graphics performance.\n\nAlthough Windows includes base drivers for many common devices, some hardware requires specialized device drivers that must be installed and occasionally updated.\n\nMany drivers are designed to be installed offline without booting the Windows image.\n\nUse Windows Assessment tools to make sure that the apps and hardware that you're installing can perform well in a variety of circumstances.\n\n## <span id=\"Architecture\"></span><span id=\"architecture\"></span><span id=\"ARCHITECTURE\"></span>Architecture\n\n\nIf you plan to build devices with both 64-bit and 32-bit (x86) chipsets and architectures, you'll need separate base images.

Once you've built a higher edition, however, you can't downgrade it to the lower edition. For more info, see [Windows Upgrade Paths](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526838).\n\nIf you're building devices to sell to retail customers, you'll need to meet a set of minimum requirements. For info, see the Licensing and Policy guidance on the [OEM Partner Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131358).\n\nIf you're building devices for businesses, you'll have fewer restrictions. IT professionals can customize their devices in all sorts of ways. However, you should consider the implications of IT policies, as well as customer needs such as migrating data, activating security tools, and managing volume license agreements and product keys.\n\n## <span id=\"Regions\"></span><span id=\"regions\"></span><span id=\"REGIONS\"></span>Regions\n\n\nConsider creating different base images for different regions.\n\nThe resource files for Windows and other apps like Microsoft Office can be large - some resources like localized handwriting and speech recognition resources are several hundred megabytes.\n\nTo save drive space, we've split up the language packs. This can help you preload more languages for your customers or save space on your image. For example, to target a large region, you may preload the basic language components such as text and user interface files for many areas within the region, but only include the handwriting recognition for devices with pens, or only include voice and speech tools for Cortana on devices with integrated microphones. Users can download these components later as needed.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
