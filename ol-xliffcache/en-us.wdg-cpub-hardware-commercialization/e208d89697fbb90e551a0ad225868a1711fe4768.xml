Store app performance assessment can help you optimize your app for a better customer experience. The assessment measures how quickly the app opens and suspends, and the amount of resources it uses on the PC. You can use this assessment to help you improve an individual app, or to help you optimize a Windows image by picking fast and fluid apps that run well on your PC.\n\nIn this topic:\n\n-   [Before You Begin](#bkmk-begin)\n\n-   [Settings](#bkmk-settings)\n\nFor more information about results and issues produced by this assessment, see [Results for the Windows Store App Performance Assessment](results-for-the-windows-store-app-performance-assessment.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-begin\"></a>Before You Begin\n\n\n**Warning**  \nThe first-run help tips in Windows 8.1 can negatively affect assessment results. To disable these, run the following command from an elevated command prompt, and reboot the computer: `reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EdgeUI\" /v DisableHelpSticker /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f`\n\n \n\n**Warning**  \nRun this assessment only while the desktop is full screen. Do not run this assessment if you have another Windows Store app opened side-by-side with the desktop.\n\n \n\n**Note**  \nThe Windows Store app performance assessment only provides results for Windows Store apps on the PC, it does not assess desktop applications.\n\n \n\nFor best results:\n\n-   Exit any open desktop applications.\n\n-   Complete any first-run tasks on apps you want to assess. For example, some apps require a user login, user acceptance of a license agreement, or UI settings the first time the app is run.\n\n-   Make sure all apps are up-to-date. You can open the Windows Store to check for any pending updates on apps installed on your PC.\n\n-   Do not interact with the PC while the assessment is running.\n\n-   Ensure that Ngen.exe has been run for each app prior to the first run of the assessment by doing one of the following:\n\n    1.  Manually run Ngen.exe by running the following command via an elevated prompt, substituting *&lt;DotNetVersion&gt;* for any version of .NET that is installed on the computer:\n\n        `%WinDir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\<DotNetVersion>\\Ngen.exe ExecuteQueuedItems`\n\n    2.  Run the app for approximately 30 seconds. This causes a scheduled task to run that includes Ngen.exe.\n\n### System requirements\n\nYou can run this assessment on the following operating systems:\n\n-   Windows 8\n\n-   Windows® RT\n\n-   Windows 8.1\n\n-   Windows RT 8.1\n\n-   Windows 10\n\nSupported architectures include x86-based, x64-based, and ARM-based systems.\n\nYou can run this assessment on a Windows RT 8.1 system in either of the following ways:\n\n-   Package the assessment job in the Windows® Assessment Console, and then run it on Windows RT 8.1. For more information about this option, see [Package a Job and Run It on Another Computer](package-a-job-and-run-it-on-another-computer.md).\n\n-   Use Windows Assessment Services. For more information, see [Windows Assessment Services Technical Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=215628).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-settings\"></a>Settings\n\n\nYou can use the default settings or customize the settings for an assessment. When you review the results, you can see whether the assessment used the recommended settings or custom settings so that you can compare results from the same jobs across multiple computers or over time.\n\nThe following table describes the assessment settings, recommended values, and alternative values for each setting.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Use recommended settings</p></td>\n<td><p>By default, this check box is selected and recommended settings are used.
