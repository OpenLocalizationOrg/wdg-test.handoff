This process occurs in the background and does not interrupt the use of the device.\n\nThe automatic scan occurs on the following schedule:\n\n-   Every 6.2 days when on a cellular connection. This will trigger up to one day earlier if a Wi-Fi connection is available.\n\n-   Every day when the device is on AC power and when the user is not actively using the device.\n\n-   Each time the device is rebooted, the scan starts 60 minutes after boot is complete.\n\nThe automatic scan uses either a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection:\n\n1.  For the first scan, the device scans when either a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection is available.\n\n2.  For the first scan after a successful update, the device scans when either a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection is available.\n\n3.  If time since previous scan is less than 6.2 days, the phone will only scan if a Wi-Fi connection is available.\n\n4.  If time since previous scan is 6.2 days or more, the phone will scan if either a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection is available.\n\n5.  After an update completes, the device reboots and performs another immediate scan for updates.\n\nUsers can enable or disable automatic scan in the **Phone update** menu: **Tell me when updates are available for my phone**. By default, this setting is not visible, and the default setting is checked. OEMs can change whether the setting is visible, and change its default setting. Users can use the phone update menu to manually check for updates and track the progress of updates.\n\n## <span id=\"Downloading_updates\"></span><span id=\"downloading_updates\"></span><span id=\"DOWNLOADING_UPDATES\"></span>Downloading updates\n\n\nBy default, if the device is on a Wi-Fi connection, the update downloads automatically.

The default size is 100 MB, configurable by the MO.\n\n-   If the device is under the limit, they’ll be prompted with an option to download the update using their cellular connection.\n\n    If the user chooses to download the update over their cellular connection, the user may be charged for that data depending on their data plan with their MO. The MO can configure updates to be free of charge to the user. To learn more, see [Enable zero-rating (no-charge) downloads for device updates](enable-zero-rating--no-charge--downloads-for-device-updates.md).\n\nIf they postpone the download, it will prompt them later:\n\n-   **Normal updates**: Prompts every 27 hours.\n\n-   **Strongly suggested updates**: Prompts every 27 hours for 3 retries. After that, it prompts every 4 hours.\n\n-   **Mandatory updates**: Prompts every 4 hours.\n\nIf there is an unrecoverable error during the download (such as insufficient space), the update keeps retrying. For critical errors, the update stage goes back to scan for updates and starts again.\n\nUsers can enable or disable the automatic download in the **Phone update** menu: **Automatically download updates if my data settings allow it**.
