# oobeSystem


The **oobeSystem** configuration pass configures settings that are applied during the end-user first-boot experience, also called Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE). The **oobeSystem** configuration pass settings are processed before a user first logs on to Windows®.

Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) runs the first time the user starts a newly configured computer. OOBE runs before the Windows shell or any additional software runs, and it performs a small set of tasks that are required to configure and run Windows.

The following diagram illustrates the process that occurs when an end user first boots a newly configured computer. The result is OOBE, or a user's first-boot experience.

You can configure Windows to boot to OOBE by running the **sysprep** command by using the **/oobe** option. By default, after running Windows Setup, OOBE starts.
