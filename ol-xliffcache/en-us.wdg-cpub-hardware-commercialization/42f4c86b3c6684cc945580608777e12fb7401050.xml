Files\n\n\nThe following section describes the relationship between common deployment scenarios and their associated log files. Windows® deployment is a highly customizable process, which has the potential for many points of failure. Identifying the specific point of failure you have encountered begins with understanding how the underlying technologies work.\n\n## <span id=\"Windows_Setup_Scenario\"></span><span id=\"windows_setup_scenario\"></span><span id=\"WINDOWS_SETUP_SCENARIO\"></span>Windows Setup Scenario\n\n\nThis scenario begins with completing Windows Setup on a new computer, so that you arrive at the desktop. This scenario is most common when you are creating a reference image. This process is also known as the *first user experience*.\n\nAs shown in the following illustration, the key to solving failures is identifying where you are in the installation process and when a failure occurs. Because you are creating a new installation, the hard drive is not initially available, so Windows Setup writes logs into memory, specifically in a Windows PE session (X:\\\\Windows). After the hard drive is formatted, Setup continues logging directly onto the new hard drive (C:\\\\Windows). Log files created during the Windows PE session are temporary.\n\n![windows setup log files](images/dep-win8-l-setup-failure-log.jpg)\n\nWhen a failure occurs in Windows Setup, review the entries in the Setuperr.log file first, then the Setupact.log file second, and then other log files as needed.\n\n### <span id=\"Windows_Setup-Related_Log_Files\"></span><span id=\"windows_setup-related_log_files\"></span><span id=\"WINDOWS_SETUP-RELATED_LOG_FILES\"></span>Windows Setup-Related Log Files\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Log file</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Location</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Setupact.log</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Primary log file for most errors that occur during the Windows installation process.

Offline servicing is an efficient way to manage existing images that are stored on a server, because it eliminates the need for recreating updated images. You can perform offline servicing on an image that is mounted or applied to a drive or directory.\n\n![offline servicing failure analysis](images/adk-win8-l-di-offlineservicingfailureanalysis.jpg)\n\nThe Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool is the primary tool for all offline-servicing tasks. DISM runs from a command prompt from Windows PE or a running Windows operating system. If a failure occurs when executing a DISM command, the tool will provide an immediate response, and log the issue in the DISM.log file. The Session.xml file is a transaction log file that captures all servicing activities on the target operating system. The Session.xml file can be used in conjunction with the DISM.log file to determine points of failures and the required servicing activity.\n\nWhen a failure occurs in offline servicing, look at the DISM.log file first for specific errors.
