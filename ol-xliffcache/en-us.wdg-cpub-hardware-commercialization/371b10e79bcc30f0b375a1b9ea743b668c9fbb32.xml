The **oobeSystem** configuration pass settings are processed before a user first logs on to Windows®.\n\nOut-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) runs the first time the user starts a newly configured computer. OOBE runs before the Windows shell or any additional software runs, and it performs a small set of tasks that are required to configure and run Windows.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the process that occurs when an end user first boots a newly configured computer. The result is OOBE, or a user's first-boot experience.\n\n![windows welcome configuration pass](images/dep-win8-l-windowswelcomeconfigpass.jpg)\n\nYou can configure Windows to boot to OOBE by running the **sysprep** command by using the **/oobe** option. By default, after running Windows Setup, OOBE starts.\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n[How Configuration Passes Work](how-configuration-passes-work.md)\n\n[auditSystem](auditsystem.md)\n\n[auditUser](audituser.md)\n\n[generalize](generalize.md)\n\n[offlineServicing](offlineservicing.md)\n\n[specialize](specialize.md)\n\n[windowsPE](windowspe.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
