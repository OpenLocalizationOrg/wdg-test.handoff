id=\"Display_at_Boot_Time\"></span><span id=\"display_at_boot_time\"></span><span id=\"DISPLAY_AT_BOOT_TIME\"></span>Display at Boot Time\n\nFor a platform that has a console device, the UEFI 2.0 specification requires the firmware to implement the Simple Text Output Protocol. Optionally, the firmware can also support a graphical protocol. UEFI 2.0 defines the Graphic Output Protocol (GOP), and EFI 1.1 defines the Universal Graphics Adapter (UGA) Protocol. Windows supports all three protocols, but the user experience with each protocol is different. For the best experience, if the firmware implements a graphical protocol, Windows recommends and prefers the GOP.\n\nWindows requires a graphical protocol to render glyphs for non-English message resources. To do so, the firmware must support the following:\n\n1.  A graphical protocol—either GOP or UGA.\n\n2.  Either 1024x768 display resolution with 32-bit pixel color or 800x600 display resolution with 24-bit pixel color.\n\nIf the firmware does not support any of these graphics modes, Windows still functions, but all boot display reverts to text mode and English.\n\nWindows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008 require GOP to display a high-resolution, animated image during boot. If GOP is not available, Windows uses the video graphics array (VGA) standard to display a lower resolution image and a simple progress indicator. For an optimal boot experience with these versions of Windows, sealed platforms without expansion card slots can safely boot with graphics mode enabled and eliminate transitions to text mode.\n\nWhenever the firmware boot manager hands off execution to a Windows EFI application, platform firmware and the firmware boot manager must not use the frame buffer for any purpose.\n\n### <span id=\"Input_at_Boot_Time\"></span><span id=\"input_at_boot_time\"></span><span id=\"INPUT_AT_BOOT_TIME\"></span>Input at Boot Time\n\nFor a platform that has a console device, the UEFI 2.0 specification requires the firmware to implement the Simple Input Protocol.
