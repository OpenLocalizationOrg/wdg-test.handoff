# Part 2: Mobile deployment using Windows Provisioning


In this section, we'll go through the process of customizing and building a mobile image using the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD). Windows ICD provides a hybrid method for customizing and building a mobile image because it lets you use both a Windows Provisioning answer file (WPAF) to configure the runtime settings, enterprise policies, and enrollment settings available in Windows Provisioning, and a Managed Centralized Settings Framework (MCSF) customization answer file (CAF) to fully customize the device hardware and connectivity settings, preload apps, and add assets such as ringtones and localized strings.

-   [Use the Windows ICD UI to customize and build a mobile image](use-the-windows-icd-ui-to-customize-and-build-a-mobile-image.md)

    If you are new to Windows mobile development, this is the best place to start.

-   [Use the Windows ICD CLI to customize and build a mobile image](use-the-windows-icd-cli-to-customize-and-build-a-mobile-image.md)

    This method uses the Windows ICD CLI to build a customized mobile image.

Before proceeding with either of the walkthroughs, you must first complete the steps in [Prepare for Windows mobile development](preparing-for-windows-mobile-development.md) and [Configure the Start layout](configure-the-start-layout.md). Windows Provisioning/Windows ICD understands MCSF CAF so if you want to learn how to create a CAF, see [Configure customization settings](configure-customization-settings.md).
