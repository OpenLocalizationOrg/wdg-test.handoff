computer\n\n\nWhen you create a job that you want to run on a different computer, you don't have to install the Windows Assessment Toolkit on that computer. You can use the Windows Assessment Console to package that job so that it includes all the necessary files and tools to run on a different computer.\n\n**Important**  \nA packaged job can run from a network share, but for best results run the job from the local computer to reduce run-time failures, or performance issues caused by the network.\n\n \n\n**To package a job to run on a different computer**\n\n1.

In the **Package a Job to Run on Another Computer** dialog box, type notes that will help you identify your job when you select results to open and view.\n\n6.

Click **OK**.\n\n    When the job is packaged, the location where you stored the job will open. You can take the folder to another computer and run the job without installing the Windows Assessment Toolkit by using the RunJob.cmd file that's in the folder.\n\n**To run a packaged job on a different computer**\n\n1.
