Also, you can see the IP address from which this account requested TGS, when TGS was requested, which encryption type was used, and so on. For recommendations for using and analyzing the collected information, see the ***Security Monitoring Recommendations*** sections.<br>We recommend Failure auditing, because you will see all failed requests and be able to investigate the reason for failure. You will also be able to detect Kerberos issues or possible attack attempts. |\n| Member Server     | No              | No              | No               | No               | This subcategory makes sense only on domain controllers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Workstation       | No              | No              | No               | No               | This subcategory makes sense only on domain controllers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4769](event-4769.md)(S, F): A Kerberos service ticket was requested.\n\n-   [4770](event-4770.md)(S): A Kerberos service ticket was renewed.\n\n-   [4773](event-4773.md)(F): A Kerberos service ticket request failed.\n\n"}
