For info how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer \nAppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).\n\n**To create a new rule with a file hash condition**\n\n1.  Open the AppLocker console, and then click the rule collection that you want to create the rule for.\n2.  On the **Action** menu, click **Create New Rule**.\n3.  On the **Before You Begin** page, click **Next**.\n4.  On the **Permissions** page, select the action (allow or deny) and the user or group that the rule should apply to, and then click **Next**.\n5.  On the **Conditions** page, select the **File hash** rule condition, and then click **Next**.\n6.  **Browse Files** to locate the targeted application file.\n\n    >**Note:**  You can also click **Browse Folders** which calculates the hash for all the appropriate files relative to the rule collection. To remove hashes individually, click the **Remove** button.\n     \n7.  Click **Next**.\n8.  On the **Name** page, either accept the automatically generated rule name or type a new rule name, and then click **Create**.\n"}
