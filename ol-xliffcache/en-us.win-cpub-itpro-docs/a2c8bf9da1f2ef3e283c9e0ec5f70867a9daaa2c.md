# Investigate Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection alerts

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14332 or later
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

<span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>

Alerts in Windows Defender ATP indicate possible security breaches on endpoints in your organization.

There are three alert severity levels, described in the following table.

Alert severity | Description
:---|:---
High (Red) | Threats often associated with advanced persistent threats (APT). These alerts indicate a high risk due to the severity of damage they can inflict on endpoints.
Medium (Orange) | Threats rarely observed in the organization, such as anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and observed behaviors typical of attack stages.
Low (Yellow) | Threats associated with prevalent malware and hack-tools that do not appear to indicate an advanced threat targeting the organization.

Reviewing the various alerts and their severity can help you decide on the appropriate action to protect your organization's endpoints.

Alerts are organized in three queues, by their workflow status:

- **New**
- **In progress**
- **Resolved**

To begin investigating, click on an alert in [any of the alert queues](alerts-queue-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

Details displayed about the alert include:
- When the alert was last observed
- Alert description
- Recommended actions
- The potential scope of breach
- The indicators that triggered the alert

Alerts attributed to an adversary or actor display a colored tile with the actor name.

Click on the actor's name to see a threat intelligence profile of the actor, including a brief overview of the actor, their interests or targets, tools, tactics, and processes (TTPs) as well as areas where it's active worldwide. You will also see a set of recommended actions to take.

Some actor profiles include a link to download a more comprehensive threat intelligence report.
