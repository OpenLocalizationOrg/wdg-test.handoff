Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To create a template based on an existing GPO**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click the **Controlled** or **Uncontrolled** tab to display available GPOs.\n\n3.  Right-click the GPO from which you want to create a template, then click **Save as Template**.\n\n4.  Type a name for the template and a comment, then click **OK**.\n\n5.  When the **Progress** window indicates that overall progress is complete, click **Close**. The new template appears on the **Templates** tab.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Editor or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Create Template** permissions for the domain.\n\n-   Renaming or deleting a template does not impact GPOs created from that template.\n\n-   Because it cannot be altered, a template does not have a history.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Creating a Template and Setting a Default Template](creating-a-template-and-setting-a-default-template.md)\n\n-   [Request the Creation of a New Controlled GPO](request-the-creation-of-a-new-controlled-gpo.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
