setup issues, Exchange ActiveSync errors.\n\nCommon issues are listed in the following table, along with causes and possible fixes. The [Setup troubleshooting](#setup-troubleshooting) section contains a listing of on-device problems, along with several types of issues that may be encountered during the first-run experience. The [Exchange ActiveSync errors](#exchange-activesync-errors) section lists common errors the device may encounter when trying to synchronize with an Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync server.\n\n-   [Setup troubleshooting](#setup-troubleshooting)\n-   [Exchange ActiveSync errors](#exchange-activesync-errors)\n\n## Setup troubleshooting\n\n\nThis section lists causes, and possible fixes to help troubleshoot issues you might find when you set up your Microsoft Surface Hub.\n\n### On-device\n\nPossible fixes for issues on the Surface Hub after you've completed the first-run program.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Issue</th>\n<th>Causes</th>\n<th>Possible fixes</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">\n<p>Not receiving automatic accept/decline messages.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The device account isn't configured to automatically accept/decline messages.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Use PowerShell cmdlet <code>Set-CalendarProcessing $upn -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept</code>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The device account isn't configured to process external meeting requests.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Use PowerShell cmdlet <code>Set-CalendarProcessing $upn -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $true</code>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Calendar is not showing on the Welcome screen, or message \"Appointments of date (no account provisioned)\" is being displayed.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No device account is set up on this Surface Hub.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Provision a device account through Settings.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Calendar is not showing on the Welcome screen or message \"Appointments of date (overprovisioned)\" is being displayed.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The device account is provisioned on too many devices.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Remove the device account from other devices that it's provisioned to.
