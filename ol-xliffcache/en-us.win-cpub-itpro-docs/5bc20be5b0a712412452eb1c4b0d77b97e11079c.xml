This directory also exists virtually on the computer to which a sequenced application will be streamed. You should create the package root directory before you monitor the installation of a new application.\n\nAfter you have created the package root directory, you can begin sequencing applications. For more information about sequencing a new application, see [How to Install the Sequencer](how-to-install-the-sequencer.md).\n\n**To create the package root directory**\n\n1.  To create the package root directory, on the computer running the App-V Sequencer, map the Q:\\\\ drive to the specified network location. The location you specify should have sufficient space to save the application you are sequencing.\n\n2.  To create a directory that you can use for a new virtual application, create a folder on the Q:\\\\ drive and assign it a name.\n\n    **Important**  \n    The name you assign to virtual application files that will be saved in the package root directory should use the 8.3 naming format. The file names should be no longer than 8 characters with a three-character file name extension.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Tasks for the Application Virtualization Sequencer](tasks-for-the-application-virtualization-sequencer.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
