the capabilities of the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), providing comprehensive change control and enhanced management for Group Policy Objects (GPOs).\n\nWith AGPM you can:\n\n-   Perform offline editing of GPOs, so you can create and test them before deploying to a production environment.\n\n-   Retain multiple versions of a GPO in a central archive, so you can roll back if a problem occurs.\n\n-   Share the responsibility for editing, approving, and reviewing GPOs among multiple people using role-based delegation.\n\n-   Eliminate the danger of multiple Group Policy administrators overwriting each other's work by using a check-in/check-out capability for GPOs.\n\n-   Analyze changes to a GPO, comparing it to another GPO or another version of the same GPO using difference reporting.\n\n-   Simplify the creation of new GPOs by using GPO templates, storing standard settings to use as starting points for new GPOs.\n\nAGPM adds a **Change Control** folder under each domain displayed in the GPMC, as well as a **History** tab for each GPO and Group Policy link displayed in the GPMC.\n\n-   [Overview of Advanced Group Policy
