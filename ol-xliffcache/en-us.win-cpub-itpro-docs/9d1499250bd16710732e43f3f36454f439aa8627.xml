The following procedure outlines the steps you must follow to connect the console to an Application Virtualization System.\n\n**To connect to an Application Virtualization System**\n\n1.  Right-click the Application Virtualization System node in the **Scope** pane, and select **Connect to Application Virtualization System** from the pop-up menu.\n\n    **Note**  \n    There are three components to Application Virtualization server management: the Application Virtualization Management Console, the Management Web Service, and the SQL Datastore. If these components are distributed across different physical machines, you must configure security properly for the components to communicate across the system.
