**Actions typically performed by the SYSTEM account**: This event and certain other events should be monitored to see if they are triggered by any account other than SYSTEM.

database administrators, built-in local administrator account, domain administrators, service accounts, domain controller accounts and so on.                    | Monitor this event with the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** and “**Account Modified\\\\Account Name”** that correspond to the high-value account or accounts.

malicious actions. For example, you might need to monitor for use of an account outside of working hours.                                                                                                   | When you monitor for anomalies or malicious actions, use the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** (with other information) to monitor how or when a particular account is being used.

                    | Monitor this event with the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** that corresponds to the accounts that should never be used.

that are the only ones allowed to perform actions corresponding to particular events.                                                                                                                                                                         | If this event corresponds to a “whitelist-only” action, review the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** for accounts that are outside the whitelist.<br>If you have specific user logon rights policies, for example, a whitelist of accounts that can log on to certain computers, monitor this event to confirm that it was appropriate that the “**Access Right**” was removed from “**Account Modified\\\\Account Name**.”

types**: You might want to ensure that certain actions are performed only by certain account types, for example, local or domain account, machine or user account, vendor or employee account, and so on.                                                                                                    | If this event corresponds to an action you want to monitor for certain account types, review the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** and “**Account Modified\\\\Account Name”** to see whether the account type is as expected.<br>For example, if critical remote network service accounts have user logon rights which should never be removed (for example, **SeNetworkLogonRight**), monitor this event for the **“Account Modified\\\\Account Name”** and the appropriate rights.<br>As another example, if non-service accounts should never be granted certain logon rights (for example, **SeServiceLogonRight**), you might monitor this event, because a right can be removed only after it was previously granted. |\n| **External accounts**: You might be monitoring accounts from another domain, or “external” accounts that are not allowed to perform certain actions (represented by certain specific events).                                                                                                                                        | Monitor this event for the **“Subject\\\\Account Domain”** corresponding to accounts from another domain or “external” accounts.

perform only limited actions, or no actions at all.                                                                                                                                        | Monitor the target **Computer:** (or other target device) for actions performed by the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** that you are concerned about. Also be sure to check “**Account Modified\\\\Account Name**” to see whether logon rights should be removed from that account.<br>For high-value servers or other computers, we recommend that you track this event and investigate whether the specific “**Access Right**” should be removed from “**Account Modified\\\\Account Name**” in each case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| **Logon rights that should be restricted**: You might have a list of user logon rights that you want to monitor (for example, **SeServiceLogonRight**).<br>**“Deny” rights that should not be removed**: Your organization might use “Deny” rights that should not be removed, for example, SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight. | -   Monitor this event and compare the **“Access Right”** to your list of restricted rights.<br>Monitor this event to discover the removal of a right that should never have been granted, so that you can investigate further.<br>You can also monitor this event to discover the removal of “Deny” rights. When these rights are removed, it could be an approved action, done by mistake, or part of malicious activity.
