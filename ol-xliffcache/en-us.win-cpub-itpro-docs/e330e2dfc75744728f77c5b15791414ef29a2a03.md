# Before you start using IEAK 11
Go through this list, making sure you’ve answered all of the questions before you run Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) and the Customization Wizard.

- Have you determined which licensing version of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 to install? For info, see [Determine the licensing version and features to use in IEAK 11](licensing-version-and-features-ieak11.md).

-   Do you meet the necessary hardware and software requirements? See [Hardware and software requirements for IEAK 11](hardware-and-software-reqs-ieak11.md).

-   Have you gotten all of the URLs you’ll need so you can customize your **Home**, **Search**, and **Support** pages? See [Use the Important URLs - Home Page and Support page in the IEAK 11 Wizard](important-urls-home-page-and-support-ieak11-wizard.md).

-   Have you reviewed the security features, determining how you want to set up and manage them? See [Security features and IEAK 11](security-and-ieak11.md).

-   Have you created a test lab, where you can run the test version of your browser package to make sure it runs properly?
