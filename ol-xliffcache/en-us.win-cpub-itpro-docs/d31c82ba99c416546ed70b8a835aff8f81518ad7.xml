For implementation, you must plan the groups that will hold the device accounts in each zone, the network access groups that will be used to determine who can access an isolated server, and the GPOs with the connection security and firewall rules to apply to corresponding groups. Finally you must determine how you will ensure that the policies will only apply to the correct devices within each group.\n\n-   [Planning Isolation Groups for the Zones](planning-isolation-groups-for-the-zones.md)\n\n-   [Planning Network Access Groups](planning-network-access-groups.md)\n\n-   [Planning the GPOs](planning-the-gpos.md)\n\n-   [Planning GPO Deployment](planning-gpo-deployment.md)\n"}
