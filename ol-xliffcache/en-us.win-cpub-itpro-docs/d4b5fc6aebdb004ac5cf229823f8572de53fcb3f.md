**To configure a management tool in Azure AD**

1.  Sign in to the Azure Portal as an Administrator.

2.  Click **Active Directory**, and then choose your directory. 

3.  Click **Applications**, find the application, and add it to your directory.

After your management tool is added to your Azure AD directory, you can configure it to work with Store for Business.
