features differ from Software Restriction Policies.\n\nAppLocker advances the app control features and functionality of Software Restriction Policies. AppLocker contains new capabilities and extensions that allow you to create rules to allow or deny apps from running based on unique identities of files and to specify which users or groups can run those apps.\n\nUsing AppLocker, you can:\n\n-   Control the following types of apps: executable files (.exe and .com), scripts (.js, .ps1, .vbs, .cmd, and .bat), Windows Installer files (.mst, .msi and .msp), and DLL files (.dll and .ocx), and packaged apps and packaged app installers (appx).\n-   Define rules based on file attributes derived from the digital signature, including the publisher, product name, file name, and file version. For example, you can create rules based on the publisher attribute that is persistent through updates, or you can create rules for a specific version of a file.\n-   Assign a rule to a security group or an individual user.\n-   Create exceptions to rules. For example, you can create a rule that allows all Windows processes to run except Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).\n-   Use audit-only mode to deploy the policy and understand its impact before enforcing it.\n-   Import and export rules. The import and export affects the entire policy. For example, if you export a policy, all of the rules from all of the rule collections are exported, including the enforcement settings for the rule collections. If you import a policy, all criteria in the existing policy are overwritten.\n-   Streamline creating and managing AppLocker rules by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets.\n\nAppLocker helps reduce administrative overhead and helps reduce the organization's cost of managing computing resources by decreasing the number of help desk calls that result from users running unapproved apps\n\nFor information about the application control scenarios that AppLocker addresses, see [AppLocker policy use scenarios](applocker-policy-use-scenarios.md).\n\n## What features are different between Software Restriction Policies and AppLocker?\n\n**Feature differences**\n\nThe following table compares AppLocker to Software Restriction Policies.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Feature</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Software Restriction Policies</th>\n<th align=\"left\">AppLocker</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Rule scope</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>All users</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Specific user or group</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Rule conditions provided</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>File hash, path, certificate, registry path, and Internet zone</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>File hash, path, and publisher</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Rule types provided</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Defined by the security levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Disallowed</p></li>\n<li><p>Basic User</p></li>\n<li><p>Unrestricted</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Allow and deny</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Default rule action</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Unrestricted</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Implicit deny</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Audit-only mode</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Wizard to create multiple rules at one time</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Policy import or export</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Rule collection</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows PowerShell support</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Custom error messages</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>No</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Yes</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n \n**Application control function differences**\n\nThe following table compares the application control functions of Software Restriction Policies (SRP) and AppLocker.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Application control function</th>\n<th align=\"left\">SRP</th>\n<th align=\"left\">AppLocker</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Operating system scope</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SRP policies can be applied to all Windows operating systems beginning with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>AppLocker policies apply only to those supported operating system versions and editions listed in [Requirements to use AppLocker](requirements-to-use-applocker.md).
