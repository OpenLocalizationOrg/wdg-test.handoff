Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “change group type” operation.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name.

For example: ServiceDesk\n\n-   **Group Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: domain or computer name of the changed group.

User Privileges.”.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4764(S): A group’s type was changed.\n\n> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).\n\n-   If you have a list of critical local or domain groups in the organization, and need to specifically monitor these groups for any change, especially group type change, monitor events with the “**Group\\\\Group Name”** values that correspond to the critical distribution groups. Examples of critical local or domain groups are built-in local administrators group, domain admins, enterprise admins, critical distribution groups, and so on.\n\n-   If you need to monitor each time any group’s type is changed, to see who changed it and when, monitor this event. Typically, this event is used as an informational event, to be reviewed if needed.\n\n"}
