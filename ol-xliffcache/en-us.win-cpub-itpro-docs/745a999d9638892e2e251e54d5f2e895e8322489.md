Designing any deployment starts by performing several important tasks:

-   [Identifying Your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Design Goals](identifying-your-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-deployment-goals.md)

-   [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Design](mapping-your-deployment-goals-to-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design.md)

-   [Evaluating Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Design Examples](evaluating-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design-examples.md)

After you identify your deployment goals and map them to a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security design, you can begin documenting the design based on the processes that are described in the following topics:

-   [Designing A Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy](designing-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-strategy.md)
