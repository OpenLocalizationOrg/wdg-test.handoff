# Monitoring and Reporting BitLocker Compliance with MBAM 2.0


You can generate different reports to monitor BitLocker usage and compliance activities.

If you chose the Configuration Manager topology when you installed Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), reports are generated from Configuration Manager rather than from MBAM. See [Understanding MBAM Reports in Configuration Manager](understanding-mbam-reports-in-configuration-manager.md) for more information.

## Understand MBAM Reports


MBAM reports have many fields that you may want to be familiar with before generating MBAM reports.
