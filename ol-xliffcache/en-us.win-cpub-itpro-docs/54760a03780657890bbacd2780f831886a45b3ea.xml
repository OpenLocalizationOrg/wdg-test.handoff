On a computer with DaRT 7 installed, click **Start** / **All Programs** / **Microsoft DaRT 7**.\n\n2.  Provide the required information for the following:\n\n    -   Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows\n\n    -   Symbol files\n\n        For more information about symbol files, see, [How to Ensure that Crash Analyzer Can Access Symbol Files](how-to-ensure-that-crash-analyzer-can-access-symbol-files-dart-7.md).\n\n    -   A crash dump file\n\n        **Note**  \n        Use the Search tool in DaRT 7 to locate the copied crash dump file.\n\n         \n\n3.  The **Crash Analyzer** scans the crash dump file and reports a probable cause of the crash. You can view more information about the crash, such as the specific crash message and description, the drivers loaded at the time of the crash, and the full output of the analysis.\n\n4.  Decide upon an appropriate strategy to resolve the problem. This may require disabling or updating the device driver that caused the crash by using the **Services and Drivers** node of the **Computer Management** tool in DaRT.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Diagnosing System Failures with Crash Analyzer](diagnosing-system-failures-with-crash-analyzer--dart-7.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
