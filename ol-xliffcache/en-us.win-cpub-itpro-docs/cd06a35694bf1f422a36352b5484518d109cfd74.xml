The **Virtual File System** tab displays the entire virtual file system for a sequenced application package. It also allows you to add, edit, and delete file associations.\n\nFor information about the virtual file system and its use, see the section “VFS Installs” of [Advanced Sequencing Topics](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114543), at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114543.\n\n## Columns\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"from\"></a>**From**  \nDisplays the application's component files in the SFT file as they will be distributed on an Application Virtualization Desktop Client.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"to\"></a>**To**  \nDisplays the application's component files as they have been distributed by the application installer on the Application Virtualization Sequencer.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Modify File-Mapping Information](how-to-modify-file-mapping-information.md)\n\n[Sequencer Console](sequencer-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
