Client for Disconnected Operation Mode\n\n\nThe disconnected operation mode enables the Application Virtualization (App-V) Desktop Client or the Application Virtualization (App-V) Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) to run applications that are stored in the file system cache of the client when the client cannot connect to the App-V Management Server.\n\n**Important**  \nIn a large organization where multiple Remote Desktop Session Host (RD°Session Host) servers (formerly Terminal Servers) are linked in a farm to support many users, using a single App-V Management Server to support the farm represents a single point of failure. To provide high availability to support the RD Session Host farm, consider linking two or more App-V Management Servers to use the same database.\n\n \n\n**To enable disconnected operation mode**\n\n-   Set the following registry key value equal to 1 to enable disconnected operation mode:\n\n    HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\SoftGrid\\\\4.5\\\\Client\\\\Network\\\\AllowDisconnectedOperation\n\n**To set a time limit on disconnected operation mode use**\n\n1.  Set the following registry key value to 1:\n\n    HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\SoftGrid\\\\4.5\\\\Client\\\\Network\\\\LimitDisconnectedOperation\n\n2.  Set the following registry key value to the number of minutes you want to limit disconnected operation mode. The valid range of values is 1–999999.
