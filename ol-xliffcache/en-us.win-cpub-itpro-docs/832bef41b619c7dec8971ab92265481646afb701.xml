The following assumes that the App-V 4.6 SP3 client is already installed.\n\nUse the following information to install the App-V 5.0 client (preferably, with the latest Service Packs and hotfixes) and the App-V 4.6 SP3 client on the same computer. For supported versions, requirements, and other planning information, see [Planning for Migrating from a Previous Version of App-V](planning-for-migrating-from-a-previous-version-of-app-v.md).\n\n**To deploy the App-V 5.0 client and App-V 4.6 client on the same computer**\n\n1.  Install the App-V 5.0 SP3 client on the computer that is running the App-V 4.6 version of the client. For best results, we recommend that you install all available updates to the App-V 5.0 SP3 client.\n\n2.  Convert or re-sequence the packages gradually.\n\n    -   To convert the packages, use the App-V 5.0 package converter and convert the required packages to the App-V 5.0 (**.appv**) file format.\n\n    -   To re-sequence the packages, consider using the latest version of the Sequencer for best results.\n\n    For more information about publishing packages, see [How to Publish a Package by Using the Management Console](how-to-publish-a-package-by-using-the-management-console-50.md).\n\n3.  Deploy packages to the client computers.\n\n4.  Convert extension points, as needed. For more information, see the following resources:\n\n    -   [How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to a Converted App-V 5.0 Package for All Users on a Specific Computer](how-to-migrate-extension-points-from-an-app-v-46-package-to-a-converted-app-v-50-package-for-all-users-on-a-specific-computer.md)\n\n    -   [How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to App-V 5.0 for a Specific User](how-to-migrate-extension-points-from-an-app-v-46-package-to-app-v-50-for-a-specific-user.md)\n\n    -   [How to Convert a Package Created in a Previous Version of App-V](how-to-convert-a-package-created-in-a-previous-version-of-app-v.md)\n\n5.  Test that your App-V 5.0 packages are successful, and then remove the 4.6 packages. To check the user state of your client computers, we recommend that you use [User Experience Virtualization](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn458947.aspx) or another user environment management tool.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
