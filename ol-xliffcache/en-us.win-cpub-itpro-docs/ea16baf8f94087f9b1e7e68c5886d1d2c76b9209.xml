Before you start the configuration, see [Configuring MBAM 2.5 Server Features by Using Windows PowerShell](configuring-mbam-25-server-features-by-using-windows-powershell.md) to review the prerequisites for using Windows PowerShell.\n\n2.  Use the **Enable-MbamWebApplication** cmdlet to configure the web applications using Windows PowerShell. To get information about this cmdlet, type **Get-Help Enable-MbamWebApplication**.\n\n**To configure the settings for all web applications using the wizard**\n\n1.  On the server where you want to configure the web applications, start the MBAM Server Configuration wizard. You can select **MBAM Server Configuration** from the **Start** menu to open the wizard.\n\n2.  Click **Add New Features**, select **Administration and Monitoring Website** and **Self-Service Portal**, and then click **Next**. The wizard checks that all prerequisites for the web applications have been met.\n\n3.  If the prerequisite check is successful, click **Next** to continue. Otherwise, resolve any missing prerequisites, and then click **Check prerequisites again**.\n\n4.

When you finish your entries, click **Next**.\n\n    The wizard checks that all prerequisites for the web applications have been met.\n\n4.  Click **Next** to continue.\n\n5.  On the **Summary** page, review the features that will be added.\n\n    **Note**  \n    To create a Windows PowerShell script for the entries you made, click **Export PowerShell Script** and save the script.\n\n     \n\n6.  Click **Add** to add the web applications to the server, and then click **Close**.\n\n    To customize the Self-Service Portal by adding custom notice text, your company name, pointers to more information, and so on, see [Customizing the Self-Service Portal for Your Organization](customizing-the-self-service-portal-for-your-organization.md).\n\n**To configure the Self-Service Portal if client computers cannot access the CDN**\n\n1.  Determine whether you are running Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 SP1. If so, do nothing. Your Self-Service Portal configuration is complete.\n\n    **Note**  \n    Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 SP1 installs the JavaScript files in setup, and so does not need to be connected to the Microsoft Ajax Content Delivery Network in order to configure the Self-Service Portal. The following steps are necessary only if you are using a version of Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 previous to SP1.\n\n     \n\n2.  Determine if your client computers have access to the Microsoft Ajax Content Delivery Network (CDN).\n\n    The CDN gives the Self-Service Portal the access it requires to certain JavaScript files. If you don’t configure the Self-Service Portal when client computers cannot access the CDN, only the company name and the account under which the end user signed in will be displayed. No error message will be shown.\n\n3.  Do one of the following:\n\n    -   If your client computers have access to the CDN, do nothing. Your Self-Service Portal configuration is complete.\n\n    -   If your client computers do not have access to the CDN, complete the steps in [How to Configure the Self-Service Portal When Client Computers Cannot Access the Microsoft Content Delivery Network](how-to-configure-the-self-service-portal-when-client-computers-cannot-access-the-microsoft-content-delivery-network.md).\n\n    **Got a suggestion for MBAM**?
