This helps you determine whether UE-V is the right solution to manage user settings across multiple devices within your enterprise.\n\n**Note**  \nThe information in this section is repeated in greater detail throughout the rest of the documentation. So if you already know that UE-V 2 is the right solution and you don’t need to evaluate it, you can just go right to [Prepare a UE-V 2.x Deployment](prepare-a-ue-v-2x-deployment-new-uevv2.md).\n\n \n\nThe standard installation of UE-V synchronizes the default Microsoft Windows and Office settings and many Windows app settings. Make sure your test environment includes two or more user computers that share network access and you’ll be evaluating UE-V in just a short time.\n\n-   [Step 1: Confirm Prerequisites](#step1): Make sure your environment is able to run UE-V, including details about supported configurations.\n\n-   [Step 2: Deploy the Settings Storage Location for UE-V 2](#step2): All UE-V deployments require a location for settings packages that contain the synchronized setting values.\n\n-   [Step 3: Deploy the UE-V 2 Agent](#step3): To synchronize settings using UE-V, devices must have the UE-V Agent installed and running.\n\n-   [Step 4: Test Your UE-V 2 Evaluation Deployment](#step4): Run a few tests on two computers that have the UE-V Agent installed and see how UE-V works.\n\nThat’s it! Once you follow the steps, you’ll be able to evaluate how UE-V can work in your enterprise.\n\n**Further evaluation:** You can also perform additional steps to configure some third-party and line-of-business applications to synchronize their settings using UE-V as detailed in [Deploy UE-V 2.x for Custom Applications](deploy-ue-v-2x-for-custom-applications-new-uevv2.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"step1\"></a>Step 1: Confirm Prerequisites\n\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure your environment includes these requirements for running UE-V.\n\n<table style=\"width:100%;\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Operating system</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Edition</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Service pack</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>System architecture</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Windows PowerShell</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Microsoft .NET Framework</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows 7</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Ultimate, Enterprise, or Professional Edition</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SP1</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>32-bit or 64-bit</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows PowerShell 3.0 or higher</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>.NET Framework 4 or higher</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows Server 2008 R2</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter, or Web Server</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SP1</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>64-bit</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows PowerShell 3.0 or higher</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>.NET Framework 4 or higher</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows 8 and Windows 8.1</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Enterprise or Pro</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>None</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>32-bit or 64-bit</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows PowerShell 3.0 or higher</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>.NET Framework 4.5</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Standard or Datacenter</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>None</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>64-bit</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows PowerShell 3.0 or higher</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>.NET Framework 4.5</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nAlso…\n\n-   **MDOP License:** This technology is a part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP).

When you create the settings storage share, you should limit access to users that require it. [Deploy a Settings Storage Location](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn458891.aspx#ssl) provides more detailed information.\n\n**Create a network share**\n\n1.  Create a new security group and add UE-V users to it.\n\n2.  Create a new folder on the centrally located computer that stores the UE-V settings packages, and then grant the UE-V users access with group permissions to the folder. The administrator who supports UE-V must have permissions to this shared folder.\n\n3.  Assign UE-V users permission to create a directory when they connect. Grant full permission to all subdirectories of that directory, but block access to anything above.\n\n    1.

Change the default fonts.\n\n    3.  Open Calculator and set to **scientific**.\n\n    4.  Change the behavior of any Windows app, as detailed in [Managing UE-V 2.x Settings Location Templates Using Windows PowerShell and WMI](managing-ue-v-2x-settings-location-templates-using-windows-powershell-and-wmi-both-uevv2.md).\n\n    5.  Disable Microsoft Account settings synchronization and Roaming Profiles.\n\n2.  Log off Computer A. Settings are saved in a UE-V settings package when users lock, logoff, exit an application, or when the sync provider runs (every 30 minutes by default).\n\n3.  Log in to the second computer (Computer B) as the same user as Computer A.\n\n4.  Open to Windows Desktop and verify that the taskbar location matches that of Computer A. Verify that the default fonts match and that Calculator is set to **scientific**. Also verify the change you made to any Windows app.\n\nYou can change the settings in Computer B back to the original Computer A settings. Then log off Computer B and log in to Computer A to verify the changes.\n\n## Other resources for this product\n\n\n-   [Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) 2.x](index.md)\n\n-   [Prepare a UE-V 2.x Deployment](prepare-a-ue-v-2x-deployment-new-uevv2.md)\n\n-   [Administering UE-V 2.x](administering-ue-v-2x-new-uevv2.md)\n\n-   [Troubleshooting UE-V 2.x](troubleshooting-ue-v-2x-both-uevv2.md)\n\n-   [Technical Reference for UE-V 2.x](technical-reference-for-ue-v-2x-both-uevv2.md)\n\n## Got a suggestion for UE-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://uev.uservoice.com/forums/280428-microsoft-user-experience-virtualization).
