The information is automatically generated unless otherwise noted. This tab contains the following elements.\n\n## Package Information\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"package-name\"></a>**Package Name**  \nThe single name used for a sequenced application package that might contain one or more applications—for example, Microsoft Office could be used to label a sequenced application package that contains Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel applications that run in the same virtual environment.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"comments\"></a>**Comments**  \nDisplays a short description of the software package that will appear in the Open Software Descriptor (OSD) file ABSTRACT element. This item is optional.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"package-version\"></a>**Package Version**  \nThe sequenced application package version.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"package-guid\"></a>**Package GUID**  \nThe globally unique identifier (GUID) automatically assigned to the sequenced application package to distinguish it from other sequenced application packages that might be running on the computer to which a sequenced application package is streamed.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"package-version-guid\"></a>**Package Version GUID**  \nThe sequenced application package version GUID.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"root-directory\"></a>**Root Directory**  \nThe directory on the sequencing computer in which files for the sequenced application package are installed. This directory is also created on the computer to which a sequenced application package will be streamed. It is recommended for backwards compatibility that this be an 8.3 format directory name at the root of the Q drive, such as Q:\\\\MyApp.1\\\\.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"created\"></a>**Created**  \nThe date and time the sequenced application package was created.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"modified\"></a>**Modified**  \nThe date and time the sequenced application package was last modified.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"package-size\"></a>**Package Size**  \nThe size of the package in megabytes.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"launch-size\"></a>**Launch Size**  \nThe size in megabytes of the portion of the SFT file that is required to start the application.\n\n## Sequencing Parameters\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"block-size\"></a>**Block Size**  \nSpecifies the size of the primary and secondary feature blocks into which the SFT file is divided for streaming across a network. All blocks equal the specified size; however, the last block might be smaller than specified.
