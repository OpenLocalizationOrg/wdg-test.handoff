The App-V Sequencer monitors and records all installation and setup processes for an application and creates the following files: ICO, OSD, SFT, and SPRJ. These files contain all the necessary information about an application, and they allow that application to run in a virtual environment.\n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization-sequencer-console-overview\"></a>[Application Virtualization Sequencer Console Overview](application-virtualization-sequencer-console-overview.md)  \nProvides information about the menu, toolbar, and tabs on the Application Virtualization Sequencer Console.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"about-sequencing-phases\"></a>[About Sequencing Phases](about-sequencing-phases.md)  \nProvides information about sequencing an application.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-the-app-v-sequencer\"></a>[How to Configure the App-V Sequencer](how-to-configure-the-app-v-sequencer.md)  \nProvides a set of procedures you can use to configure the Application Virtualization Sequencer.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"configuring-the-application-virtualization-sequencer--app-v-4-6-sp1-\"></a>[Configuring the Application Virtualization Sequencer (App-V 4.6 SP1)](configuring-the-application-virtualization-sequencer--app-v-46-sp1-.md)  \nProvides a set of procedures you can use to configure the Application Virtualization Sequencer.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-create-or-upgrade-virtual-applications-using--the-app-v-sequencer\"></a>[How to Create or Upgrade Virtual Applications Using the App-V Sequencer](how-to-create-or-upgrade-virtual-applications-using--the-app-v-sequencer.md)  \nProvides step-by-step procedures for sequencing or upgrading virtual application, using either the user interface or the command line.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"tasks-for-the-application-virtualization-sequencer--app-v-4-6-sp1-\"></a>[Tasks for the Application Virtualization Sequencer (App-V 4.6 SP1)](tasks-for-the-application-virtualization-sequencer--app-v-46-sp1-.md)  \nProvides step-by-step procedures for sequencing or upgrading virtual application.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"troubleshooting-application-virtualization-sequencer-issues\"></a>[Troubleshooting Application Virtualization Sequencer Issues](troubleshooting-application-virtualization-sequencer-issues.md)  \nProvides troubleshooting tips for a variety of issues that you might encounter when working with the App-V Sequencer.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization-sequencer-reference\"></a>[Application Virtualization Sequencer Reference](application-virtualization-sequencer-reference.md)  \nProvides detailed technical reference material related to working with the Application Virtualization Sequencer.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Client](application-virtualization-client.md)\n\n[Application Virtualization Server](application-virtualization-server.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
