Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) (Internet Explorer 11 for IT Pros)\n---\n\n# List of updated features and tools - Internet Explorer 11 (IE11)\n\n**Applies to:**\n\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows 8.1 Update\n-   Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)\n-   Windows Server 2012 R2\n-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)\n\nInternet Explorer 11 includes several new features and tools. This topic includes high-level info about the each of them.\n\n## Updated features and tools\n-   **Updated web standards.** WebGL, Canvas 2D L2 extensions, fullscreen API, encrypted media extensions, media source extensions, CSS flexible box layout module, mutation observers, like DOM4 and 5.3.\n\n-   **Enhanced Protected Mode.** Extends Protected Mode to further restrict the ability of an attacker to access sensitive or personal information in personal and corporate environments. This feature is turned off by default. For more info, see [Enhanced Protected Mode problems with Internet Explorer](enhanced-protected-mode-problems-with-ie11.md).\n\n-   **Enterprise Mode.** Enterprise Mode, a compatibility mode that runs on IE11 on Windows 8.1 Update and Windows 7 devices, lets websites render using a modified browser configuration that’s designed to emulate Windows Internet Explorer 8, avoiding the common compatibility problems associated with web apps written and tested on older versions of Internet Explorer. For more info, see [What is Enterprise Mode?](what-is-enterprise-mode.md)\n\n-   **Out-of-date ActiveX control blocking**. Helps to keep your ActiveX controls up-to-date, because malicious software (or malware) can target security flaws in outdated controls, damaging your computer by collecting info from it, installing unwanted software, or by letting someone else control it remotely. For more info, see [Out-of-date ActiveX control blocking](out-of-date-activex-control-blocking.md).\n\n-   **Do Not Track (DNT) exceptions.** IE11 lets websites ask whether to track users as they browse a website. If the user approves the request, IE records an exception to the \"Do Not Track\" rule and sends headers to the website that allow tracking. By respecting these headers and requesting exceptions to the default privacy settings, website owners can develop a trusted relationship with their users about privacy. For more info, see [Internet Explorer 11 - FAQ for IT Pros](../ie11-faq/faq-for-it-pros-ie11.md).\n\n-   **IE Administration Kit (IEAK).** Lets you create custom, branded versions of IE11. For more info and to download the tool, see [Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) - Administration Guide for IT Pros](../ie11-ieak/index.md).\n\n-   **Unattend Settings.** Lets you update the Unattend.xml file, to customize the home page, favorites, search providers, feeds, Accelerators, Web Slices, and settings for top result searches. For more info, see the [Unattend Settings: Microsoft-Windows-IE-InternetExplorer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263709).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
