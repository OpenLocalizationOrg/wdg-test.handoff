Short file name (8.3) support is disabled by default for non-system physical drives on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.\n\n**Workaround:** Enable short file name (8.3) support on non-system physical drives. You can use the following command to enable short file name support on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.\n\n``` syntax\nfsutil 8dot3name set <virtual drive letter>:\n```\n\nFor example, use the following command if the drive letter is “Q:”:\n\n``` syntax\nfsutil 8dot3name set Q: 0\n```\n\n**Note**  \nYou do not need to change this setting on the App-V client because the App-V file system properly handles short paths on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"-------------app-v-does-not-override-the-default-handler-for-file-type-or-protocol-associations-on-windows-8\"></a> App-V does not override the default handler for file type or protocol associations on Windows 8\n\nIf you select a default application by using **Default Programs** in **Control Panel** on Windows 8, App-V will not override the associated file type associations for that application.\n\n**Workaround:** None.\n\n### Virtualized Outlook 2010 is not offered as an option for mailto clickable links on Windows 8\n\nThe mailto shell extension does not offer virtualized Outlook 2010 on Windows 8.
