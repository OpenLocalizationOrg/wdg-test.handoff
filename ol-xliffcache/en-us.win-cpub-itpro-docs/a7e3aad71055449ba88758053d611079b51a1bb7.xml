to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Filtering Platform Packet Drop determines whether the operating system generates audit events when packets are dropped by the [Windows Filtering Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\nWindows Filtering Platform (WFP) enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to filter and modify TCP/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security (IPsec)-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls (RPCs).\n\nA high rate of dropped packets *may* indicate that there have been attempts to gain unauthorized access to computers on your network.\n\n**Event volume**: High.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger
