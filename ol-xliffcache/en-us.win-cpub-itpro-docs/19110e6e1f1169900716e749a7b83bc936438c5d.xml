  Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Kernel Object determines whether the operating system generates audit events when users attempt to access the system kernel, which includes mutexes and semaphores.\n\nOnly kernel objects with a matching system access control list ([SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)) generate security audit events. The audits generated are usually useful only to developers.\n\nTypically, kernel objects are given SACLs only if the AuditBaseObjects or AuditBaseDirectories auditing options are enabled.\n\nThe “[Audit: Audit the access of global system objects](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj852233.aspx)” policy setting controls the default SACL of kernel objects.\n\n**Event volume**: High.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | No              | No              | No               | No               | Typically Kernel object auditing events have little to no security relevance and are hard to parse or analyze.
