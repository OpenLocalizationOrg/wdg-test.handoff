Use the following procedure to determine whether the volumes have been encrypted on computers that are no longer in your possession.\n\n**Determine a Computer's Last Known BitLocker Encryption state**\n\n1.  Open the MBAM website.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The default address for the MBAM website is http://*&lt;computername&gt;*. Use the fully qualified server name for faster browsing results.\n\n     \n\n2.  Select the **Report** node from the navigation pane, and then select the **Computer Compliance Report**.\n\n3.  Use the filter fields in the right-side pane to narrow the search results, and then click **Search**. Results will be shown below your search query.\n\n4.  Take the appropriate action as determined by your policy for lost devices.\n\n    **Note**  \n    Device compliance is determined by the deployed BitLocker policies. You should verify these deployed policies when you are trying to determine the BitLocker encryption state of a device.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Performing BitLocker Management with MBAM](performing-bitlocker-management-with-mbam.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
