To verify that you have met the prerequisites and hardware and software requirements, see [MBAM 1.0 Deployment Prerequisites](mbam-10-deployment-prerequisites.md) and [MBAM 1.0 Supported Configurations](mbam-10-supported-configurations.md). In addition, some features require that you provide certain information during the installation process to successfully deploy the feature.\n\n**Note**  \nTo obtain the setup log files, you have to install MBAM by using the **msiexec** package and the **/l &lt;location&gt;** option.

Use the following procedure to confirm that the MBAM service is functional.\n\n**To validate an MBAM installation**\n\n1.  On each server, where an MBAM feature is deployed, open **Control Panel**, click **Programs**, and then click **Programs and Features**. Verify that **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** appears in the **Programs and Features** list.\n\n    **Note**  \n    To validate the MBAM installation, you must use a Domain Account that has local computer administrative credentials on each server.\n\n     \n\n2.  On the server where the Recovery and Hardware Database is installed, open SQL Server Management Studio and verify that the **MBAM Recovery and Hardware** database is installed.\n\n3.  On the server where the Compliance and Audit Database is installed, open SQL Server Management Studio and verify that the **MBAM Compliance Status** database is installed.\n\n4.  On the server where the Compliance and Audit Reports are installed, open a web browser with administrative privileges and browse to the “Home” of the SQL Server Reporting Services site.\n\n    The default Home location of a SQL Server Reporting Services site instance can be found at http://*&lt;NameofMBAMReportsServer&gt;*/Reports.aspx. To find the actual URL, use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager tool and select the instances specified during setup.\n\n    Confirm that a folder named **Malta Compliance Reports** is listed and that it contains five reports and one data source.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If SQL Server Reporting Services was configured as a named instance, the URL should resemble the following:http://*&lt;NameofMBAMReportsServer&gt;*/Reports\\_*&lt;SRSInstanceName&gt;*\n\n     \n\n5.  On the server where the Administration and Monitoring feature is installed, run **Server Manager** and browse to **Roles**, select **Web Server (IIS)**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**. In **Connections** browse to *&lt;computername&gt;*, click **Sites**, and click **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring**. Verify that **MBAMAdministrationService**, **MBAMComplianceStatusService**, and **MBAMRecoveryAndHardwareService** are listed.\n\n6.  On the server where the Administration and Monitoring feature is installed, open a web browser with administrative privileges and browse to the following locations in the MBAM web site, to verify that they load successfully:\n\n    -   *http://&lt;computername&gt;/default.aspx* and confirm each of the links for navigation and reports\n\n    -   *http://&lt;computername&gt;/MBAMAdministrationService/AdministrationService.svc*\n\n    -   *http://&lt;computername&gt;/MBAMComplianceStatusService/StatusReportingService.svc*\n\n    -   *http://&lt;computername&gt;/MBAMRecoveryAndHardwareService/CoreService.svc*\n\n    **Note**  \n    Typically, services are installed on the default port 80 without network encryption. If the services are installed on a different port, change the URLs to include the appropriate port. For example, http://*&lt;computername&gt;:&lt;port&gt;*/default.aspx or http://*&lt;hostheadername&gt;/*default.aspx\n\n    If the services were installed with network encryption, change http:// to https://.\n\n     \n\n    Verify that each web page loads successfully.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Deploying the MBAM 1.0 Server Infrastructure](deploying-the-mbam-10-server-infrastructure.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
