Counters\n\n\nMicrosoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) provides performance counters that record the performance of requests that are sent to the following web services:\n\n-   **StatusReportingService.svc** – service that receives requests for compliance status\n\n-   **CoreService.svc** – service that receives requests for key recovery attempts\n\n## Performance counters that MBAM provides\n\n\nMBAM provides the following performance counters for each of the public methods that is implemented by its StatusReportingService and CoreService web services:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Type of performance counter</th>\n<th

This increase will be proportional to the number of new client computers. The average request duration will remain relatively static. As the server nears its maximum capacity, the requests per second start to level out, and the average request duration starts to get longer.\n\nIf you are concerned about whether your MBAM Servers can support your client base, consider deploying MBAM in phases across different collections of client computers. As you deploy MBAM to each collection of client computers, we recommend that you take snapshots of the performance counters to see the relative impact of deploying to each new client collection. If the number of requests per second starts to level off and the average request duration increases, consider enhancing your MBAM Server infrastructure by doing one of the following:\n\n-   Moving the MBAM database onto a dedicated Microsoft SQL Server or SQL Server cluster\n\n-   Load-balancing MBAM across multiple Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers\n\n-   Deploying MBAM on more powerful server hardware\n\n## Viewing performance counters\n\n\nThe recommended tool for viewing MBAM performance counters is Windows Performance Monitor, which comes with Windows. If you are using Windows PowerShell, you don’t need to enable the counters before viewing them, as they are automatically registered by the Windows PowerShell **Enable-webapplication** cmdlet.\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to view performance counters, see [How to View MBAM Performance Counters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393457).\n\n## Got a suggestion for MBAM?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://mbam.uservoice.com/forums/268571-microsoft-bitlocker-administration-and-monitoring).
