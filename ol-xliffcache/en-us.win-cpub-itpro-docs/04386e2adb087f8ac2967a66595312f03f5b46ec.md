# Use the Connection Settings page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Connection Settings** page of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK 11) Customization Wizard lets you import the connection settings from your computer, to preset the connection settings on your employee’s computers.

**Note**<br>Using the options on the **Additional Settings** page of the wizard, you can let your employees change their connection settings. For more information see the [Additional Settings](additional-settings-ieak11-wizard.md) page. You can also customize additional connection settings using the **Automatic Configuration** page in the wizard. For more information see the [Automatic Configuration](auto-config-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
