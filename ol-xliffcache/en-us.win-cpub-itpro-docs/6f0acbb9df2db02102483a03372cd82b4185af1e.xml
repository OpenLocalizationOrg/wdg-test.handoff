You can delegate access to GPOs in the archive at the domain level or GPO level. Additionally, you can back up the archive so that you may be able to recover it if a disaster occurs.\n\nAs an AGPM Administrator, you can export a GPO to a file, copy the file to another forest, and then import the GPO into a domain in that forest. Unlike an Editor, you can import policy settings from a GPO backup directly into a new controlled GPO when you create it. For information about how to export a GPO, see [Export a GPO to a File](export-a-gpo-to-a-file.md).\n\n-   [Delegate Domain-Level Access to the Archive](delegate-domain-level-access-to-the-archive-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Delegate Access to an Individual GPO in the Archive](delegate-access-to-an-individual-gpo-in-the-archive-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Limit the GPO Versions Stored](limit-the-gpo-versions-stored-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Import a GPO from a File](import-a-gpo-from-a-file-agpmadmin.md)\n\n-   [Back Up the Archive](back-up-the-archive-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Restore the Archive from a Backup](restore-the-archive-from-a-backup-agpm40.md)\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   For information about how to delegate access to GPOs in the production environment, see [Delegate Access to the Production Environment](delegate-access-to-the-production-environment-agpm40.md).\n\n-   For information about how to move the archive, see [Move the AGPM Server and the Archive](move-the-agpm-server-and-the-archive-agpm40.md).\n\n-   [Performing AGPM Administrator Tasks](performing-agpm-administrator-tasks-agpm40.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
