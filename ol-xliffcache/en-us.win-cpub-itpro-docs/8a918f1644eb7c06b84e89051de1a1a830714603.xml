Image Pre-staging\n\n\n**Note**  \nImage pre-staging is useful only for the initial image download. It is not supported for image update.\n\n \n\n## How to Configure Image Pre-staging\n\n\n**To configure image pre-staging**\n\n1.  On the client computer, under the image store directory, create a folder for the pre-staging image, and name it *MED-V Images*.\n\n    **Note**  \n    This folder must be called *MED-V Images*.\n\n     \n\n2.  Inside the MED-V Images folder, create a subfolder and name it *PrestagedImages*.\n\n    **Note**  \n    This folder must be called *PrestagedImages*.\n\n     \n\n3.  To apply Access Control Lists (ACL) security to the *MED-V Images* folder, set the following ACL:\n\n    **NT AUTHORITY\\\\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(special access:)**\n\n                                             **READ\\_CONTROL**\n\n                                    **SYNCHRONIZE**\n\n                                    **FILE\\_GENERIC\\_READ**\n\n                                    **FILE\\_READ\\_DATA**\n\n    **                                 FILE\\_APPEND\\_DATA**\n\n                                    **FILE\\_READ\\_EA**\n\n                                    **FILE\\_READ\\_ATTRIBUTES**\n\n    **NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F**\n\n    **BUILTIN\\\\Administrators:(OI)(CI)F**\n\n    **Note**  \n    It is recommended to apply ACL security to the *MED-V Images* folder.\n\n     \n\n4.  To apply ACL security to the *PrestagedImages* folder, set the following ACL:\n\n    **NT AUTHORITY\\\\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(special access:)**\n\n    **                                READ\\_CONTROL**\n\n    **                                                                                SYNCHRONIZE**\n\n    **                                                                                FILE\\_GENERIC\\_READ**\n\n    **                                                                                                FILE\\_READ\\_DATA**\n\n    **                                                                                FILE\\_READ\\_EA**\n\n    **                                                                                FILE\\_READ\\_ATTRIBUTES**\n\n    **NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F**\n\n    **BUILTIN\\\\Administrators:(OI)(CI)F**\n\n    **Note**  \n    It is recommended to apply ACL security to the *PrestagedImages* folder.\n\n     \n\n5.  Push the image files (CKM and INDEX files) to the *PrestagedImages* folder.\n\n    **Note**  \n    After the image files have been pushed to the pre-stage folder, it is recommended to run a data integrity check and to mark the files as read-only.\n\n     \n\n6.  Include the following parameter in the MED-V client installation: *Client.MSI VMSFOLDER=”C:\\\\MED-V Images”*.\n\n## How to Update the Pre-stage Location\n\n\n**To update the pre-stage location**\n\n1.  The registry key, *PrestagedImagesPath*, points to the default image location. It is located in the following directory:\n\n    -   On an x86 - `KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Kidaro`\n\n    -   On an x64 - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432node`\n\n2.  If the image is in a different location, change the path.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
