best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting determines whether users can use private keys, such as their Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) key, without a password.\n\nConfiguring this policy setting so that users must provide a password every time they use a key (in addition to their domain password) makes it more difficult for a malicious user to access locally-stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control of the user's device and determines their logon password.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   **User input is not required when new keys are stored and used**\n-   **User is prompted when the key is first used**\n-   **User must enter a password each time they use a key**\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set this policy to **User must enter a password each time they use a key**. Users must enter their password every time they access a key that is stored on their computer. For example, if users use an S/MIME certificate to digitally sign their email, they will be forced to enter the password for that certificate every time they send a signed email message. For some organizations, the overhead that is caused by using this value might be too high, but they should set the value at a minimum to **User is prompted when the key is first used**.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Not defined| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings| Not defined| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nIf a user's account is compromised or the user's device is inadvertently left unsecured, the malicious user can use the keys that are stored for the user to access protected resources.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nConfigure the **System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer** setting to **User must enter a password each time they use a key** so that users must provide a password that is distinct from their domain password every time they use a key. This configuration makes it more difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control of the user's computer and determines the logon password.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nUsers must type their password every time they access a key that is stored on their device. For example, if users use an S/MIME certificate to digitally sign their email, they are forced to type the password for that certificate every time they send a signed email message. For some organizations, the overhead that is involved by using this configuration may be too high. At a minimum, this setting should be set to **User is prompted when the key is first used**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
