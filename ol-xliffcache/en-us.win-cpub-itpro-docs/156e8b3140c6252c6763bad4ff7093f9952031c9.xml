The following errors are displayed:\n\n`[0A5C:06F8][2014-09-12T19:08:00]i102: Detected related bundle: {bee44f0f-05be-48e4-81dd-d34a83600b95}, type: Upgrade, scope: PerMachine, version: 5.0.1218.0, operation: MajorUpgrade``[0A5C:06F8][2014-09-12T19:08:00]i000: AppvUX: A previous version of this product is installed; requesting upgrade.``[0A5C:06F8][2014-09-12T19:08:00]i102: Detected related bundle: {e1ca9d65-0ebf-4fd5-98e5-00d6453967a4}, type: Upgrade, scope: PerMachine, version: 5.0.1224.0, operation: MajorUpgrade``[0A5C:06F8][2014-09-12T19:08:00]i000: AppvUX: A previous version of this product is installed; requesting upgrade.`\n\nThe issue occurs because the Server files are not being deleted when you uninstall App-V 5.0 SP1, so the App-V 5.0 SP3 installation process erroneously does an upgrade instead of a new installation.\n\n**Workaround**: Delete the following registry key before you start installing App-V 5.0 SP3:\n\n`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`\n\n## Querying AD DS can cause some applications to work incorrectly\n\n\nWhen you receive updated packages by querying Active Directory Domain Services for updated group memberships, it can cause some applications to work incorrectly if the applications depend on the user’s access token. In addition, frequent group membership queries can cause the domain controller to overload. For more information about user access tokens, see [Access Tokens](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374909.aspx).\n\n**Workaround**: Wait until the user logs off and then logs back on before you query for updated group memberships. Do not use the registry key, described in [Hotfix Package 2 for Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0 Service Pack 1](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2897087), to query for updated group memberships.\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization).
