Hub)\n\n\nThis topic introduces how to create and test the device account that Microsoft Surface Hub uses to communicate with Microsoft Exchange and Skype.\n\nA \"device account\" is an account that the Microsoft Surface Hub uses to:\n\n-   sync its meeting calendar,\n-   send mail,\n-   and enable Skype for Business compatibility.\n\nPeople can book this account by scheduling a meeting with it. The Surface Hub will be able to join that meeting and provide various features to the meeting attendees.\n\n>**Important**  Without a device account, none of these features will work.\n\n \n\nEvery device account is unique to a single Surface Hub, and requires some setup:\n\n-   The device account must be configured correctly, as described in the folllowing sections.\n-   Your infrastructure must be configured to allow the Surface Hub to validate the device account, and to reach the appropriate Microsoft services.\n\nYou can think of a device account as the resource account that people recognize as a conference room’s or meeting space’s account. When you want to schedule a meeting using that conference room, you invite the account to that meeting. In order to use the Surface Hub most effectively, you do the same with the device account that's assigned to each one.\n\nIf you already have a resource mailbox account set up for the meeting space where you’re putting a Surface Hub, you can change that resource account into a device account. Once that’s done, all you need to do is add the device account to a Surface Hub. See step 2 of either [On-premises deployment](on-premises-deployment-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) or [Online deployment (Office 365)](online-deployment-surface-hub-device-accounts.md).\n\nThe following sections will describe how to create and test a device account before configuring your Surface Hub.\n\n### Basic configuration\n\nThese properties represent the minimum configuration for a device account to work on a Surface Hub. Your device account may require further setup, which is covered in [Advanced configuration](#advanced-config).\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Property</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Exchange mailbox (Exchange 2010 or later, or Exchange Online)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Enabling the account with an Exchange mailbox gives the device account the capability to receive and send both mail and meeting requests, and to display a meetings calendar on the Surface Hub’s welcome screen.

These PowerShell scripts, and instructions for their use, are in [Appendix: PowerShell](appendix-a-powershell-scripts-for-surface-hub.md).\n\nYou can check online for updated versions at [Surface Hub device account scripts](http://aka.ms/surfacehubscripts).\n\n### Device account configuration\n\nYour infrastructure will likely fall into one of three configurations.
