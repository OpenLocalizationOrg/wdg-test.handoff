switch a local account to a Microsoft account, or connect a domain account to a Microsoft account to drive sync, roaming, or other background services. This is the preferred option if you need to limit the use of Microsoft accounts in your enterprise. Users will still be able to add app-specific Microsoft accounts for use with consumer apps. To block this use, turn off the ability to install consumer apps or the Store.\n\nIf you click the **Users can’t add or log on with Microsoft accounts** setting option, existing Microsoft account users will not be able to log on to Windows. Selecting this option might make it impossible for an existing administrator to log on to a computer and manage the system.\n\nIf you disable or do not configure this policy (recommended), users will be able to use Microsoft accounts with Windows.\n\n### Possible values\n-   This policy is disabled\n-   Users can’t add Microsoft accounts\n-   Users can’t add or log on with Microsoft accounts\n\nBy default, this setting is not defined on domain controllers and disabled on stand-alone servers.\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   By disabling or not configuring this policy setting on the client computer, users will be able to use their Microsoft account, local account, or domain account for their sign-in session to Windows. It also enables the user to connect a local or domain account to a Microsoft account. This provides a convenient option for your users.\n-   If you need to limit the use of Microsoft accounts in your organization, click the **Users can’t add Microsoft accounts** setting option so that users will not be able to create new Microsoft accounts on a computer, switch a local account to a Microsoft account, or connect a domain account to a Microsoft account.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy.

Additionally, if the owner of a Microsoft account is not easily distinguishable, auditing and forensics become more difficult.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nRequire only domain accounts in your enterprise by limiting the use of Microsoft accounts. Click the **Users can’t add Microsoft accounts** setting option so that users will not be able to create new Microsoft accounts on a device, switch a local account to a Microsoft account, or connect a domain account to a Microsoft account.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nEstablishing greater control over accounts in your organization can give you more secure management capabilities, including procedures around password resets.\n\n## Related topics\n\n[Security Options](security-options.md)\n \n \n"}
