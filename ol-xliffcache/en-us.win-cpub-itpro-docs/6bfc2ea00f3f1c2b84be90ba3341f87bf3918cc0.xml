Services\n\n\nUse the following procedure to install the database server and management server on different computers. The computer you plan to install the database server on must be running a supported version of Microsoft SQL or the installation will fail.\n\n**Note**  \nAfter you complete the deployment, the **Microsoft SQL Server name**, **instance name** and **database name** will be required by the administrator installing the service to be able to connect to these databases.\n\n \n\n**To install the management database and the management server on separate computers**\n\n1.  Copy the App-V 5.0 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it on. To start the App-V 5.0 server installation right-click and run **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** as an administrator. Click **Install**.\n\n2.  On the **Getting Started** page, review and accept the license terms, and click **Next**.\n\n3.  On the **Use Microsoft Update to help keep your computer secure and up-to-date** page, to enable Microsoft updates, select **Use Microsoft Update when I check for updates (recommended).** To disable Microsoft updates, select **I don’t want to use Microsoft Update**. Click **Next**.\n\n4.  On the **Feature Selection** page, select the components you want to install by selecting the **Management Server Database** checkbox and click **Next**.\n\n5.  On the **Installation Location** page, accept the default location and click **Next**.\n\n6.  On the initial **Create New Management Server Database page**, accept the default selections if appropriate, and click **Next**.\n\n    If you are using a custom SQL Server instance, then select **Use a custom instance** and type the name of the instance.\n\n    If you are using a custom database name, then select **Custom configuration** and type the database name.\n\n7.  On the next **Create New Management Server Database** page, select **Use a remote computer**, and type the remote machine account using the following format: **Domain\\\\MachineAccount**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If you plan to deploy the management server on the same computer you must select **Use this local computer**.\n\n     \n\n    Specify the user name for the management server **Install Administrator** using the following format: **Domain\\\\AdministratorLoginName**. Click **Next**.\n\n8.  To start the installation, click **Install**.\n\n**To install the reporting database and the reporting server on separate computers**\n\n1.  Copy the App-V 5.0 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it on. To start the App-V 5.0 server installation right-click and run **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** as an administrator. Click **Install**.\n\n2.

Click **Next**.\n\n8.  To start the installation, click **Install**.\n\n**To install the management and reporting databases using App-V 5.0 database scripts**\n\n1.  Copy the App-V 5.0 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it on.\n\n2.  To extract the App-V 5.0 database scripts, open a command prompt and specify the location where the installation files are saved and run the following command:\n\n    **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** **/LAYOUT** **/LAYOUTDIR=”InstallationExtractionLocation”**.\n\n3.  After the extraction has been completed, to access the App-V 5.0 database scripts and instructions readme file:\n\n    -   The App-V 5.0 Management Database scripts and instructions readme are located in the following folder: **InstallationExtractionLocation** \\\\ **Database Scripts** \\\\ **Management Database**.\n\n    -   The App-V 5.0 Reporting Database scripts and instructions readme are located in the following folder: **InstallationExtractionLocation** \\\\ **Database Scripts** \\\\ **Reporting Database**.\n\n4.  For each database, copy the scripts to a share and modify them following the instructions in the readme file.\n\n    **Note**  \n    For more information about modifying the required SIDs contained in the scripts see, [How to Install the App-V Databases and Convert the Associated Security Identifiers by Using PowerShell](how-to-install-the-app-v-databases-and-convert-the-associated-security-identifiers--by-using-powershell.md).\n\n     \n\n5.
