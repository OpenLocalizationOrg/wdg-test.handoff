The DNT:1 header signals to the servers not to track the user.<p>**In Internet Explorer 9 and 10:**<br>If you disable this policy setting, IE only sends the Do Not Track header if a Tracking Protection List is enabled or inPrivate Browsing mode is used.<p>**In at least IE11:**<br>If you disable this policy setting, IE only sends the Do Not Track header if inPrivate Browsing mode is used.<p>If you don't configure the policy setting, users can select the Always send Do Not Track header option on the Advanced tab of the Internet Options dialog box. By selecting this option, IE sends a DNT:1 header with all HTTP and HTTPS requests; unless the user grants a site-specific exception, in which case IE sends a DNT:0 header. By default, this option is enabled. |
|Let users turn on and use Enterprise Mode from the **Tools** menu |`Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer` |IE11 |This policy setting lets you decide whether users can turn on Enterprise Mode for websites with compatibility issues. Optionally, this policy also lets you specify where to get reports (through post messages) about the websites for which users turn on Enterprise Mode using the **Tools** menu.<p>If you turn this setting on, users can see and use the Enterprise Mode option from the **Tools** menu. If you turn this setting on, but don’t specify a report location, Enterprise Mode will still be available to your users, but you won’t get any reports.<p>If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, the menu option won’t appear and users won’t be able to turn on Enterprise Mode locally. |
|Use the Enterprise Mode IE website list |`Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Internet Explorer` |IE11 |This policy setting lets you specify where to find the list of websites you want opened using Enterprise Mode, instead of Standard mode, because of compatibility issues. Users can’t edit this list.<p>If you enable this policy setting, IE downloads the website list from `HKCU` or `HKLM\Software\policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\EnterpriseMode`, opening all included websites using Enterprise Mode. We recommend storing and downloading your list from a secure web server (https://), to help protect against data tampering.<p>If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, IE opens all websites using Standard mode. |
