The Host Agent resides on the host computer (a user’s computer that is running Windows 7) and provides a channel to communicate with the MED-V guest (the MED-V virtual machine running in the host computer). It also provides certain MED-V related functionality, such as application publishing.\n\nTypically, you deploy and install the MED-V Host Agent by using your company’s preferred method of provisioning software. However, before deploying MED-V across your enterprise, you might prefer to install the Host Agent locally for testing. This section provides step-by-step instructions for manually installing the MED-V Host Agent.\n\n**Note**  \nThe MED-V Guest Agent is installed automatically during first time setup.\n\n \n\n**Important**  \nClose Internet Explorer before you install the MED-V Host Agent, otherwise conflicts can occur later with URL redirection. You can also do this by specifying a computer restart during a distribution.\n\n \n\n**To install the MED-V Host Agent**\n\n1.  Locate the MED-V installation files that you received as part of your software download.\n\n2.  Double-click the MED-V\\_HostAgent\\_Setup installation file.\n\n    The **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) Host Agent Setup** wizard opens. Click **Next** to continue.\n\n3.  Accept the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then click **Next**.\n\n4.  Select the destination folder for installing the MED-V Host Agent. Click **Next**.\n\n5.  To begin the Host Agent installation, click **Install**.\n\n6.  After the installation is completed successfully, click **Finish** to close the wizard.\n\n    To verify that the installation of the Host Agent was successful, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization**, and then click **MED-V Host Agent**.\n\n**Note**  \nUntil a MED-V workspace is installed, the MED-V Host Agent can be started and runs, but provides no functionality.\n\n \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Deploy the MED-V Components Through an Electronic Software Distribution System](how-to-deploy-the-med-v-components-through-an-electronic-software-distribution-system.md)\n\n[How to Install the MED-V Workspace Packager](how-to-install-the-med-v-workspace-packager.md)\n\n[How to Uninstall the MED-V Components](how-to-uninstall-the-med-v-components.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
