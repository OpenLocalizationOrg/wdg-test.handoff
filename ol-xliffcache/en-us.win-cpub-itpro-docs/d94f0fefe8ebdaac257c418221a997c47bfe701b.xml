all drives and folders\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Recovery console: Allow floppy copy and access to all drives and folders** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting enables or disables the Recovery Console SET command, which allows you to set the following Recovery Console environment variables.\n\n-   **AllowWildCards**. Enables wildcard support for some commands, such as the DEL command.\n-   **AllowAllPaths**. Allows access to all files and folders on the device.\n-   **AllowRemovableMedia**. Allows files to be copied to removable media, such as a floppy disk.\n-   **NoCopyPrompt**. Suppresses the prompt that typically displays before an existing file is overwritten.\n\nYou might forget to remove removable media, such as CD or floppy disk, with sensitive data or applications that a malicious user could then steal. Or you could accidentally leave a startup disk in the computer after using the Recovery Console. If the device is restarted for any reason and the BIOS has been configured to boot from the removable media before the hard disk drive, the server will start from the removable disk. This causes the server's network services to be unavailable.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n-   Disabled\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set **Recovery Console: Allow floppy copy and access to drives and folders** to **Disabled**. Users who have started a server by using the Recovery Console and logged in with the built-in Administrator account will not be able to copy files and folders to a floppy disk.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nSetting and deploying this policy using Group Policy takes precedence over the setting on the local device.\n\n### Policy conflicts\n\nNone.\n\n### Command-line tools\n\nEnabling this security option makes the Recovery Console SET command available, which allows you to set the following Recovery Console environment variables:\n\n-   AllowWildCards: Enable wildcard support for some commands (such as the DEL command).\n-   AllowAllPaths: Allow access to all files and folders on the device.\n-   AllowRemovableMedia: Allow files to be copied to removable media, such as a floppy disk.\n-   NoCopyPrompt: Do not prompt when overwriting an existing file.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nAn attacker who can cause the system to restart into the Recovery Console could steal sensitive data and leave no audit or access trail.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nDisable the **Recovery console: Allow floppy copy and access to drives and folders** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nUsers who have started a server through the Recovery Console and logged in with the built-in Administrator account cannot copy files and folders to a floppy disk.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
