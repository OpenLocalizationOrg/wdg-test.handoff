Using the private store with the Store for Business, an administrator can curate the set of apps that are available to their employees.\n\nThe private store is a feature in Store for Business that organizations receive during the sign up process. When admins add apps to the private store, all employees in the organization can view and download the apps. Your private store is available as a tab in the Windows Store, and is usually named for your company or organization. Only apps with online licenses can be added to the private store. Your private store looks something like this:\n\n![](images/wsfb-wsappprivatestore.png)\n\nOrganizations using an MDM to manage apps can use a policy to show only the private store. When your MDM supports the Store for Business, the MDM can use the [Policy CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962.aspx#group-policy-table). More specifically, the **ApplicationManagement/RequirePrivateStoreOnly** policy.\n\nYou can also prevent employees from using the Windows Store.
