session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting allows a client device to require the negotiation of 128-bit encryption or NTLMv2 session security. These values are dependent on the **Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level policy** setting value.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Require NTLMv2 session security\n\n    The connection fails if strong encryption (128-bit) is not negotiated.\n\n-   Require 128-bit encryption\n\n    The connection fails if the NTLMv2 protocol is not negotiated.\n\n### Best practices\n\nPractices in setting this policy are dependent on your security requirements.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy | Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy| Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Policy conflicts\n\nThe settings for this security policy are dependent on the **Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level policy** setting value. For info about this policy, see [Network security: LAN Manager authentication level](network-security-lan-manager-authentication-level.md).\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nNetwork traffic that uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) could be exposed such that an attacker who has gained access to the network can create man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nEnable all options that are available for the **Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients policy** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nClient devices that enforce these settings cannot communicate with older servers that do not support them.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
