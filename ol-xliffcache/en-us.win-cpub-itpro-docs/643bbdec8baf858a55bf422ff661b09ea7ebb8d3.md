**To recover a corrupted drive**

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the **Administration and Monitoring Website**.

2.  In the left pane, select **Drive Recovery** to open the **Recover access to an encrypted drive** page.

3.  Enter the end user’s Windows log-on domain and user name, the reason for unlocking the drive, and the end user’s recovery password ID.

    **Note**  
    If you are a member of the Advanced Helpdesk Users access group, you do not have to enter the user’s domain name or user name.

     

4.  Click **Submit**. The recovery key will be displayed.

5.  Click **Save**, and then select **Recovery Key Package**. The recovery key package will be created on your computer.

6.  Copy the recovery key package to the computer that has the corrupted drive.

7.  Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click **Start** and type `cmd` in the **Search programs and files** text box. Right-click **cmd.exe**, and select **Run as Administrator**.

8.  At the command prompt, type the following:

    `repair-bde <corrupted drive> <fixed drive> -kp <location of keypackage> -rp <recovery password>`

    **Note**  
    Replace &lt;*fixed drive*&gt; with an available hard disk drive that has free space equal to or larger than the data on the corrupted drive. Data on the corrupted drive is recovered and moved to the specified hard disk drive.
