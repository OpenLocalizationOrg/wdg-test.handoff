Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Credential Validation determines whether the operating system generates audit events on credentials that are submitted for a user account logon request.\n\nThese events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the credentials as follows:\n\n-   For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative.\n\n-   For local accounts, the local computer is authoritative.\n\n**Event volume**:\n\n-   High on domain controllers.\n\n-   Low on member servers and workstations.\n\nBecause domain accounts are used much more frequently than local accounts in enterprise environments, most of the Account Logon events in a domain environment occur on the domain controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on any computer, and they may occur in conjunction with or on separate computers from Logon and Logoff events.\n\nThe main reason to enable this auditing subcategory is to handle local accounts authentication attempts and, for domain accounts, NTLM authentication in the domain. It is especially useful for monitoring unsuccessful attempts, to find brute-force attacks, account enumeration, and potential account compromise events on domain controllers.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | IF              | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | Expected volume of events is high for domain controllers, because this subcategory will generate events when an authentication attempt is made using any domain account and NTLM authentication. <br>IF – We recommend Success auditing to keep track of domain-account authentication events using the NTLM protocol.
