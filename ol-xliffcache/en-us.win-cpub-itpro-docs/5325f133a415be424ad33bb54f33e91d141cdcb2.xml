If an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) has not configured an AGPM Server connection for you, then you must manually configure it.\n\n**To select an AGPM Server**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  In the details pane, click the **AGPM Server** tab:\n\n    -   If the options on the **AGPM Server** tab are unavailable, they have been centrally configured by an AGPM Administrator.\n\n    -   If the options on the **AGPM Server** tab are available, type the fully-qualified computer name for the AGPM Server (for example, server.contoso.com) and the port on which the AGPM Service listens (by default, port 4600). Click **Apply**, then click **Yes** to confirm.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   The AGPM Servers selected determine which GPOs are displayed on the **Contents** tab and to what location the **Domain Delegation** tab settings are applied. If not centrally managed through the Administrative template, each Group Policy administrator must configure this setting to point to the AGPM Server for the domain.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Performing Editor Tasks](performing-editor-tasks-agpm30ops.md)\n\n-   [Performing Approver Tasks](performing-approver-tasks-agpm30ops.md)\n\n-   [Performing Reviewer Tasks](performing-reviewer-tasks-agpm30ops.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
