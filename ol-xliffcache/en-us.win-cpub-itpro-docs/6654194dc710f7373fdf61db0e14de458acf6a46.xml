(MBAM) is installed with the Configuration Manager Integrated topology, the hardware compliance and reporting features are moved into the Configuration Manager infrastructure and out of MBAM. When you use the Configuration Manager topology, you run reports from Configuration Manager rather than from MBAM, except for the Recovery Audit Report, which you continue to access by using the Administration and Monitoring Website.\n\nThe reports for the Configuration Manager Integrated topology show BitLocker compliance for the enterprise and for individual computers and devices that MBAM manages. The reports provide both tabular information and charts, and enable you to filter reports to view data from different perspectives.\n\nThe information in this topic describes the MBAM reports that you run from Configuration Manager. For information about MBAM reports for the Stand-alone topology, see [Understanding MBAM Reports](understanding-mbam-reports-mbam-2.md).\n\n## Accessing Reports in Configuration Manager\n\n\nTo access the Reports feature in Configuration Manager, open the **Configuration Manager console**. To display the list of available reports:\n\n-   In Configuration Manager 2007, expand the **Computer Management** node, and then expand the **Reporting** node.\n\n-   In System Center 2012 Configuration Manager, in the Monitoring workspace under **Overview**, expand the **Reporting** node and then click **Reports**.\n\n### BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard\n\nThe BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard provides the following graphs, which show BitLocker compliance status across the enterprise:\n\n-   Compliance Status Distribution\n\n-   Non Compliant Errors Distribution\n\n-   Compliance Status Distribution by Drive Type\n\n**Compliance Status Distribution**\n\nThis pie chart shows computer compliance statuses within the enterprise, and shows the percentage of computers, compared to the total number of computers in the selected collection, that have that compliance status. The actual number of computers with each status is also shown. The pie chart shows the following compliance statuses:\n\n-   Compliant\n\n-   Non Compliant\n\n-   User Exempt\n\n-   Temporary User Exempt\n\n-   Policy Not Enforced\n\n-   Unknown -computers whose status was reported as an error, or devices that are part of the collection but have never reported their compliance status, for example, if they are disconnected from the organization\n\n**Non Compliant Errors Distribution**\n\nThis pie chart shows the categories of computers in the enterprise that are not compliant with the BitLocker drive encryption policy, and shows the number of computers in each category. Each category percentage is calculated from the total number of non-compliant computers in the collection.\n\n-   User postponed encryption\n\n-   Unable to find compatible TPM\n\n-   System Partition not available or large enough\n\n-   Policy conflict\n\n-   Waiting for TPM auto provisioning\n\n-   An unknown error has occurred\n\n-   No information – computers that do not have the MBAM Client installed, or that have the MBAM Client installed but not activated, for example, the service is not working\n\n**Compliance Status Distribution by Drive Type**\n\nThis bar chart shows the current BitLocker compliance status by drive type. The statuses are “Compliant” and “Non Compliant.” Bars are shown for fixed data drives and operating system drives. Computers that do not have a fixed data drive are included and show a value only in the Operating System Drive bar. The chart does not include users who have been granted an exemption from the BitLocker drive encryption policy or the “No Policy” category.\n\n### BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details Report\n\nThis report shows information about the overall BitLocker compliance across your enterprise for the collection of computers that is targeted for BitLocker use.\n\n**BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details Report Fields**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Column Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Managed Computers</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Number of computers that MBAM manages.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>% Compliant</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of compliant computers in the enterprise.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>% Non-Compliant</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of non-compliant computers in the enterprise.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>% Unknown Compliance</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of computers whose compliance state is not known.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>% Exempt</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of computers exempt from the BitLocker encryption requirement.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>% Non-Exempt</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of computers exempt from the BitLocker encryption requirement.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Compliant</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of compliant computers in the enterprise.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Non-Compliant</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of non-compliant computers in the enterprise.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Unknown Compliance</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Percentage of computers whose compliance state is not known.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Exempt</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Total computers that are exempt from the BitLocker encryption requirement.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Non-Exempt</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Total computers that are not exempt from the BitLocker encryption requirement.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n**BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details Report -
