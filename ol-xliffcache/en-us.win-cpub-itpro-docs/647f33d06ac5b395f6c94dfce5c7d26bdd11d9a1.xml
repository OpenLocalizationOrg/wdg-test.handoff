Install the App-V 5.0 sequencer. For more information about installing the sequencer see [How to Install the Sequencer](how-to-install-the-sequencer-beta-gb18030.md).\n\n2.  To open a PowerShell console click **Start** and type **PowerShell**. Right-click **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as Administrator**.\n\n3.  Using the PowerShell console, type the following: **import-module appvsequencer**.\n\n4.  To create a package, use the **New-AppvSequencerPackage** cmdlet. The following parameters are required to create a package:\n\n    -   **Name** - specifies the name of the package.\n\n    -   **PrimaryVirtualApplicationDirectory** - specifies the path to the directory that will be used to install the application. This path must exist.\n\n    -   **Installer** - specifies the path to the associated application installer.\n\n    -   **Path** - specifies the output directory for the package.\n\n    For example:\n\n    **New-AppvSequencerPackage –Name &lt;name of Package&gt; -PrimaryVirtualApplicationDirectory &lt;path to the package root&gt; -Installer &lt;path to the installer executable&gt; -OutputPath &lt;directory of the output path&gt;**\n\n    Wait for the sequencer to create the package. Creating a package using PowerShell can take time. If the package was not created successfully an error will be returned.\n\n    The following list displays additional optional parameters that can be used with **New-AppvSequencerPackage** cmdlet:\n\n    -   AcceleratorFilePath – specifies the path to the accelerator .cab file to generate a package.\n\n    -   InstalledFilesPath - specifies the path to where the local installed files of the application are saved.\n\n    -   InstallMediaPath - specifies the path to where the installation media is\n\n    -   TemplateFilePath - specifies the path to a template fileif you want to customize the sequencing process.\n\n    -   FullLoad - specifies that the package must be fully downloaded to the computer running the App-V 5.0 before it can be opened.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
