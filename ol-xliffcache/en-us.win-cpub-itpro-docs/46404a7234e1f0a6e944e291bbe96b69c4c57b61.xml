sent because of actions in Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) are not encrypted and are sent through SMTP port 25. However, you can configure e-mail security for AGPM by using registry settings to specify whether to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption and which SMTP port to use.\n\nBy encrypting AGPM e-mail notifications, you can better protect those that could reveal sensitive information about your organization’s security. Encrypting e-mail notifications is recommended when they are being relayed through remote mail servers, and may be required by some compliance regulations.\n\n**Caution**  \nIncorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system. Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any valued data on the computer.\n\n \n\nA user account that has the AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role, the user account of the Approver who created the Group Policy Object (GPO) used in these procedures, or a user account that has the necessary permissions in AGPM is required to complete these procedures. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To configure e-mail security for AGPM by using Group Policy preferences**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, edit a GPO that is applied to all AGPM Servers for which you want to configure e-mail security. (For more information, see [Editing a GPO](editing-a-gpo-agpm40.md).)\n\n2.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** window, expand the **Computer Configuration**, **Preferences**, **Windows Settings**, and **Registry** folders.\n\n3.  In the console tree, right-click **Registry**, point to **New**, click **Collection Item**, and type **AGPM e-mail security**.\n\n4.  Create a Registry preference item to turn on encryption:\n\n    1.  In the console tree, right-click **AGPM e-mail security**, point to **New**, and then click **Registry Item**.\n\n    2.  In the **New Registry Properties** dialog box, select the **Update** action.\n\n    3.  For **Hive**, select **HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE**.\n\n    4.  For **Key Path**, type **SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\AGPM**.\n\n    5.  For **Value name**, type **EncryptSmtp**.\n\n    6.  For **Value type**, select **REG\\_DWORD**.\n\n    7.  For **Base**, select **Decimal**, and for **Value data**, type **1** to use SSL encryption, or **0** to let e-mail to be sent without encryption. By default, e-mail is sent without encryption. Click **OK**.\n\n5.  Create a Registry preference item to specify the SMTP port:\n\n    1.  In the console tree, right-click **AGPM E-mail security**, point to **New**, and then click **Registry Item**.\n\n    2.  In the **New Registry Properties** dialog box, select the **Update** action.\n\n    3.  For **Hive**, select **HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE**.\n\n    4.  For **Key Path** dialog box, type **SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\AGPM**.\n\n    5.  For **Value name**, type **SmtpPort**.\n\n    6.  For **Value type**, select **REG\\_DWORD**.\n\n    7.  For **Base**, select **Decimal**, and for **Value data**, type a port number for the SMTP port. By default, the SMTP port is port 25 if encryption is not enabled or port 587 if SSL encryption is enabled. Click **OK**.\n\n6.  Close the **Group Policy Management Editor** window, and then check in and deploy the GPO. For more information, see [Deploy a GPO](deploy-a-gpo-agpm40.md).\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   You must be able to edit and deploy a GPO to configure registry settings by using Group Policy Preferences. See [Editing a GPO](editing-a-gpo-agpm40.md) and [Deploy a GPO](deploy-a-gpo-agpm40.md) for additional detail.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Configuring Advanced Group Policy Management](configuring-advanced-group-policy-management-agpm40.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
