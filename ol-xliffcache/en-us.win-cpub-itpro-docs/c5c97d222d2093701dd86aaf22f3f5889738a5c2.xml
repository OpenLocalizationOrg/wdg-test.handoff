The process is the same for other report types.\n\n \n\n**To create a basic query**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click **Toggle Filter**.\n\n2.  In the Query Builder, enter your filter criteria, pressing the Tab key to add clauses.\n\n    To delete a clause, right-click the row, and then click **Delete Clause**.\n\n3.  Click **Refresh**.\n\n    Your filtered results appear. To close the Query Builder, click **Toggle Filter** again.\n\n## Querying on Objects\n\n\nYou can query your compatibility data based on its relationship with other objects. For example, in the applications report, you can query for applications that have corresponding issues. Fields that have a (+) suffix in Query Builder are collections of objects.\n\n**To query for a collection of objects**\n\n1.  In Query Builder, in the **Field** column, click any field that contains a plus sign (+) as suffix.\n\n2.  In the **Operator** column, select **Exists**, **Not Exists**, or **All Have**.\n\n    Query Builder creates a group clause, which is shown by a bracket that spans the rows that are included in the group.\n\n3.  Move your cursor to the next row in the group clause, and then in the **Field** column, select a field.\n\n4.  In the **Operator** column, select an operator.\n\n5.  In the **Value** column, enter a value, and then click **Refresh**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Example Filter Queries](example-filter-queries.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
