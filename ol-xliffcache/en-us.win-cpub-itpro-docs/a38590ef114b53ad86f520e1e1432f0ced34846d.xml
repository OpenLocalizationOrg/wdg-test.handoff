Once you publish a package, computers that are running the App-V 5.1 client can access and run the applications in that package.\n\n**Note**  \nThe ability to enable only administrators to publish or unpublish packages (described below) is supported starting in App-V 5.0 SP3.\n\n \n\n**To publish an App-V 5.1 package**\n\n1.  In the App-V 5.1 Management console. Click or right-click the name of the package to be published. Select **Publish**.\n\n2.  Review the **Status** column to verify that the package has been published and is now available. If the package is available, the status **published** is displayed.\n\n    If the package is not published successfully, the status **unpublished** is displayed, along with error text that explains why the package is not available.\n\n**To enable only administrators to publish or unpublish packages**\n\n1.  Navigate to the following Group Policy Object node:\n\n    **Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; App-V &gt; Publishing**.\n\n2.
