With both methods, use the **Access Permissions** options to add users.\n\n**To grant access to an application**\n\n1.  For an existing application, click the **Applications** node in the left pane. Right-click an application in the right pane, and choose **Properties**.\n\n2.  Select the **Access Permissions** tab.\n\n3.  To add user groups, click **Add**.\n\n4.  In the **Add/Edit User Group** dialog box, navigate to the user group. You can also enter the domain and group by typing the information in the respective fields.\n\n5.  Click **OK**. You can add other groups with the same pages.\n\n6.  When the wizard reappears, click **OK**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    You must set up your groups in Active Directory Domain Services before you attempt to grant access to applications.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Deny Access to an Application](how-to-deny-access-to-an-application.md)\n\n[How to Manage Application Groups in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-application-groups-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n[How to Manage Application Licenses in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-application-licenses-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n[How to Manually Add an Application](how-to-manually-add-an-application.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
