This type of Win32 service runs in a process by itself (this is the most common). |\n| 0x20  | ​Win32 Share Process      | ​A Win32 service that can share a process with other Win32 services.<br>(see: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685967(v=vs.85).aspx>                          |\n| 0x110 | ​Interactive Own Process  | ​A service that should be run as a standalone process and can communicate with the desktop.<br>(see: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683502(v=vs.85).aspx>)  |\n| 0x120 | Interactive Share Process | A service that can share address space with other services of the same type and can communicate with the desktop.                                                                             |\n\n-   **Service Start Type** \\[Type = HexInt32\\]: The service start type can have one of the following values (see: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682450(v=vs.85).aspx)>:\n\n| Value | Service Type        | Description                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0     | ​ Boot              | ​A device driver started by the system loader. This value is valid only for driver services.                                                            |\n| 1     | ​ System            | ​A device driver started by the IoInitSystem() function. This value is valid only for driver services.                                                  |\n| 2     | ​ Automatic         | ​A service started automatically by the service control manager during system startup.                                                                  |\n| 2     | ​ Automatic Delayed | ​A service started after all auto-start services have started, plus a delay. Delayed Auto Start services are started one at a time in a serial fashion. |\n| 3     | ​ Manual            | ​Manual start. A service started by the service control manager when a process calls the StartService function.                                         |\n| 4     | ​ Disabled          | ​A service that cannot be started. Attempts to start the service result in the error code ERROR\\_SERVICE\\_DISABLED.                                     |\n\nMost services installed are configured to **Auto Load**, so that they start automatically after Services.exe process is started.\n\n-   **Service Account** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: The security context that the service will run as when started. Note that this is what was configured when the service was installed, if the account is changed later that is not logged.\n\n    The service account parameter is only populated if the service type is a \"Win32 Own Process\" or \"Win32 Share Process\" (displayed as \"User Mode Service.\"). Kernel drivers do not have a service account name logged.\n\n    If a service (Win32 Own/Share process) is installed but no account is supplied, then LocalSystem is used.\n\n    The token performing the logon is inspected, and if it has a SID then that SID value is populated in the event (in the System/Security node), if not, then it is blank.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4697(S): A service was installed in the system.\n\n> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).\n\n-   We recommend monitoring for this event, especially on high value assets or computers, because a new service installation should be planned and expected. Unexpected service installation should trigger an alert.\n\n-   Monitor for all events where **“Service File Name”** is not located in **%windir%** or **“Program Files/Program Files (x86)”** folders. Typically new services are located in these folders.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Report all “**Service Type**” equals “**0x1**”, “**0x2**” or “**0x8**”. These service types start first and have almost unlimited access to the operating system from the beginning of operating system startup. These types are very rarely installed.\n\n-   Report all “**Service Start Type**” equals “**0**” or “**1**”. These service start types are used by drivers, which have unlimited access to the operating system.\n\n-   Report all “**Service Start Type**” equals “**4**”. It is not common to install a new service in the **Disabled** state.\n\n-   Report all “**Service Account**” not equals “**localSystem**”, “**localService**” or “**networkService**” to identify services which are running under a user account.\n\n"}
