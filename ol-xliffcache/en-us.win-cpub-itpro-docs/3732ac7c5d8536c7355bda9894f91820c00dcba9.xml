That person might then use the account name to initiate a brute-force password-guessing attack.\n\nMisuse of this policy setting is a common error that can cause data loss or problems with data access or security.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n\n    An anonymous user can request the SID attribute for another user. An anonymous user with knowledge of an administrator's SID could contact a computer that has this policy enabled and use the SID to get the administrator's name. This setting affects the SID-to-name translation as well as the name-to-SID translation\n\n-   Disabled\n\n    Prevents an anonymous user from requesting the SID attribute for another user.\n\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set this policy to Disabled. This is the default value on member computers; therefore, it will have no impact on them. The default value for domain controllers is Enabled.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Note defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Enabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings| Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n \n### Operating system version differences\n\nThe default value of this setting has changed between operating systems as follows:\n\n-   The default on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 R2 or earlier was set to Enabled.\n-   The default on domain controllers running Windows Server 2008 and later is set to Disabled.\n\n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nModifying this setting may affect compatibility with client computers, services, and applications.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nIf this policy setting is enabled, a user with local access could use the well-known Administrator's SID to learn the real name of the built-in Administrator account, even if it has been renamed. That person could then use the account name to initiate a password-guessing attack.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nDisable the **Network access: Allow anonymous SID/Name translation** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nDisabled is the default configuration for this policy setting on member devices; therefore, it has no impact on them. The default configuration for domain controllers is Enabled.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
