After installing the MBAM Client on a client computer, complete the additional steps in this topic to enable the MBAM Client to start reporting the computerâ€™s status to MBAM more quickly.\n\n**To evaluate MBAM by using the Configuration Manager 2007 Integration topology**\n\n1.  Before you install MBAM, do the following:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Task</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Where to get instructions</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Ensure that you have installed all of the prerequisite software.</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>[MBAM 2.5 Server Prerequisites for Stand-alone and Configuration Manager Integration Topologies](mbam-25-server-prerequisites-for-stand-alone-and-configuration-manager-integration-topologies.md)</p>\n    <p>[MBAM 2.5 Server Prerequisites that Apply Only to the Configuration Manager Integration Topology](mbam-25-server-prerequisites-that-apply-only-to-the-configuration-manager-integration-topology.md)</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Check the required hardware, RAM, and other specifications.</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>[MBAM 2.5 Supported Configurations](mbam-25-supported-configurations.md)</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Create or edit the .mof files.</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>[Edit the Configuration.mof File](edit-the-configurationmof-file-mbam-25.md)</p>\n    <p>[Create or Edit the Sms_def.mof File](create-or-edit-the-sms-defmof-file-mbam-25.md)</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n2.

On a client computer, do the following:\n\n    1.  Install the MBAM Client on a client computer.\n\n    2.  Apply the MBAM Group Policy Objects to the computer.\n\n    3.  Set the following registry keys to force the MBAM Client to wake up more quickly and at faster intervals:\n\n        ``` syntax\n        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\\MDOPBitLockerManagement\n        \"ClientWakeupFrequency\"=dword:00000001\n        \"StatusReportingFrequency\"=dword:00000001\n        ```\n\n        ``` syntax\n        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\MBAM] \n        \"NoStartupDelay\"=dword:00000001\n        ```\n\n        **Note**  \n        Because these keys wake up the MBAM Client every minute, we recommend that you use these registry key settings only in an evaluation environment.\n\n         \n\n    4.  Restart the **BitLocker Management Client Service**.\n\n    5.  In Control Panel, open **Configuration Manager**, and then click the **Actions** tab.\n\n    6.  Select **Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle**, and then click **Run Now** to apply the Group Policy Objects that are relevant to that client computer.\n\n    7.  Select **Hardware Inventory Cycle**, and then click **Run Now**. This step runs the hardware inventory by using the new classes that you imported to your .mof files and then sends the data to the Configuration Manager server.\n\n4.  In the Configuration Manager console, do the following:\n\n    1.  In the navigation pane, right-click **MBAM Supported Computers**, click **Update Membership**, and then click **Yes** to force the client computer to report its membership immediately.\n\n    2.  In the navigation pane, click **MBAM Supported Computers** to verify that the client computer appears in the collection.\n\n5.  On the client computer, in Control Panel, reopen **Configuration Manager** again, and do the following:\n\n    1.  Click the **Actions** tab, and then rerun **Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle**.\n\n    2.  Click the **Configurations** tab, select the BitLocker baseline, and click **Evaluate**.\n\n6.  In the Configuration Manager console, verify that the client computer appears on the Enterprise Compliance Report, as follows\n\n    1.  In the navigation pane, expand **Computer Management** &gt; **Reporting** &gt; **Reporting Services** &gt; **&lt;server name&gt;MBAM**.\n\n    2.  Within the **MBAM** node, select the folder that represents the language in which you want to view reports, and then select the report from the results pane.\n\n**Got a suggestion for MBAM**?
