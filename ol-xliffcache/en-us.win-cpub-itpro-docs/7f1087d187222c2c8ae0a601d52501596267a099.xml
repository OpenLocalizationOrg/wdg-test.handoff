When a Master Key is generated, DPAPI communicates with a domain controller. Domain controllers have a domain-wide public/private key pair, associated solely with DPAPI. The local DPAPI client gets the domain controller public key from a domain controller by using a mutually authenticated and privacy protected RPC call. The client encrypts the Master Key with the domain controller public key. It then stores this backup Master Key along with the Master Key protected by the user's password.\n\nPeriodically, a domain-joined machine will try to send an RPC request to a domain controller to back up the user’s master key so that the user can recover secrets in case his or her password has to be reset. Although the user's keys are stored in the user profile, a domain controller must be contacted to encrypt the master key with a domain recovery key.\n\nThis event also generates every time a new DPAPI Master Key is generated, for example.\n\nThis event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations.\n\nFailure event generates when a Master Key backup operation fails for some reason.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n***Event XML:***\n```\n- <Event xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event\">\n- <System>\n <Provider Name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing\" Guid=\"{54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D}\" /> \n <EventID>4692</EventID> \n <Version>0</Version> \n <Level>0</Level> \n <Task>13314</Task> \n <Opcode>0</Opcode> \n <Keywords>0x8020000000000000</Keywords> \n <TimeCreated SystemTime=\"2015-08-25T01:59:14.573672700Z\" /> \n <EventRecordID>176964</EventRecordID> \n <Correlation /> \n <Execution ProcessID=\"520\" ThreadID=\"540\" /> \n <Channel>Security</Channel> \n <Computer>DC01.contoso.local</Computer> \n <Security /> \n </System>\n- <EventData>\n <Data Name=\"SubjectUserSid\">S-1-5-21-3457937927-2839227994-823803824-500</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectUserName\">ladmin</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectDomainName\">CONTOSO</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectLogonId\">0x30c08</Data> \n <Data Name=\"MasterKeyId\">16cfaea0-dbe3-4d92-9523-d494edb546bc</Data> \n <Data Name=\"RecoveryServer\" /> \n <Data Name=\"RecoveryKeyId\">806a0350-aeb1-4c56-91f9-ef16cf759291</Data> \n <Data Name=\"FailureReason\">0x0</Data> \n </EventData>\n </Event>\n\n```\n\n***Required Server Roles:*** None.\n\n***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.\n\n***Event Versions:*** 0.\n\n***Field Descriptions:***\n\n**Subject:**\n\n-   **Security ID** \\[Type = SID\\]**:** SID of account that requested backup operation. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group.
