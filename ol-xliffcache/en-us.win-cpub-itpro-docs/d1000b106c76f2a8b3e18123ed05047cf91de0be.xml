This information is captured on the client computer by a performance counter called “App Virt Client Cache,” and it includes the following counters: “Cache size (MB),” “Cache free space (MB),” and “% free space.”\n\n**To determine client cache space usage**\n\n1.  Open a command prompt as administrator, or click **Start**, **Run**, type **perfmon.exe**, and click **OK**.\n\n2.  Depending on the Windows operating system being used, click the Performance Monitor or System Monitor tool after the MMC window opens.\n\n3.  To add counters, right-click the graph area and select **Add Counters**.\n\n4.  Click the drop-down to display the list of available counters, scroll to find **App Virt Client Cache**, and then add the three counters.\n\n    **Important**  \n    The App-V performance counters are implemented in a 32-bit DLL, so to see them, you must use the following command to start the 32-bit version of Performance Monitor: **mmc /32 perfmon.msc**.
