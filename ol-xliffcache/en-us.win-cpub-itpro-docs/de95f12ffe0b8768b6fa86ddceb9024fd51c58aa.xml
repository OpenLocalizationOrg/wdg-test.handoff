When AppLocker policy enforcement is set to **Audit only**, rules are only evaluated but all events generated from that evaluation are written to the AppLocker log.\n\n>**Note:**  There is no audit mode for the DLL rule collection. DLL rules affect specific apps. Therefore, test the impact of these rules first before deploying them to production. To enable the DLL rule collection, see [Enable the DLL rule collection](enable-the-dll-rule-collection.md).\n \nYou can perform this task by using the Group Policy Management Console for an AppLocker policy in a Group Policy Object (GPO) or by using the Local Security Policy snap-in for an AppLocker policy on a local computer or in a security template. For info how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer AppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).\n\n**To audit rule collections**\n\n1.  From the AppLocker console, right-click **AppLocker**, and then click **Properties**.\n2.  On the **Enforcement** tab, select the **Configured** check box for the rule collection that you want to enforce, and then verify that **Audit only** is selected in the list for that rule collection.\n3.  Repeat the above step to configure the enforcement setting to **Audit only** for additional rule collections.\n4.  Click **OK**.\n"}
