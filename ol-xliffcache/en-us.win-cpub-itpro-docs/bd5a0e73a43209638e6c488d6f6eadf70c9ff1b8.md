### Download for others
Download for others allows teachers or IT admins to download a packages that they can install on student PCs. This will install Minecraft: Education Edition on the PC, and allows anyone with a Windows account to use the app on that PC. This option is best for younger students, and for shared computers. Choose this option when:
- You have administrative permissions to install apps on the PC. 
- You want to install this app on each of your student's Windows 10 (at least version 1511) PCs. 
- Your students share Windows 10 computers, but sign in with their own Windows account. 

#### Requirements
- Administrative permissions are required on the PC. If you don't have the correct permissions, you won't be able to install the app. 
- Windows 10 (at least version 1511) is required for PCs running Minecraft: Education Edition.

#### Check for updates
Minecraft: Education Edition will not install if there are updates pending for other apps on the PC. Before installing Minecraft, check to see if there are pending updates for Windows Store apps. 

**To check for app updates**
1. Start Windows Store app on the PC (click **Start**, and type **Store**).
2. Click the account button, and then click **Downloads and updates**.

3. Click **Check for updates**, and install all available updates. 

      ![Windows Store app showing access to My Library](images/mc-check-for-updates.png)
      
4. Restart the computer before installing Minecraft: Education Edition. 
   
#### To download for others
You'll download a .zip file, extract the files, and then use one of the files to install Minecraft: Education Edition on each PC. 

1. 
            **Download Minecraft Education Edition.zip**. From the **Minecraft: Education Edition** page, click **Download for others** tab, and then click **Download**.

2. 
            **Extract files**. Find the .zip file that you downloaded and extract the files. This is usually your **Downloads** folder, unless you chose to save the .zip file to a different location. Right-click the file and choose **Extract all**.
3. 
            **Save to USB drive**. After you've extracted the files, save the Minecraft: Education Edition folder to a USB drive, or to a network location that you can access from each PC.  
4. 
            **Install app**. Use the USB drive to copy the Minecraft folder to each Windows 10 PC where you want to install Minecraft: Education Edition. Open Minecraft: Education Edition folder, right-click **InstallMinecraftEducationEdition.bat** and click **Run as administrator**. 
5. 
            **Quick check**. The install program checks the PC to make sure it can run Minecraft: Education Edition. If your PC passes this test, the app will automatically install.
6. 
            **Restart**. Once installation is complete, restart each PC. Minecraft: Education Edition app is now ready for any student to use.
