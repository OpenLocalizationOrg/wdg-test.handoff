Audit Database and the Recovery Database by using:\n\n-   A Windows PowerShell cmdlet\n\n-   The MBAM Server Configuration wizard\n\nThe instructions are based on the recommended architecture in [High-Level Architecture for MBAM 2.5](high-level-architecture-for-mbam-25.md).\n\n**Before you start the configuration:**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\"

Before you start the configuration, see [Configuring MBAM 2.5 Server Features by Using Windows PowerShell](configuring-mbam-25-server-features-by-using-windows-powershell.md) to review the prerequisites for using Windows PowerShell.\n\n2.  Use the **Enable-MbamDatabase** Windows PowerShell cmdlet to configure the databases. To get information about this Windows PowerShell cmdlet, type **Get-Help Enable-MbamDatabase**.\n\n**To configure the Compliance and Audit Database by using the wizard**\n\n1.  On the server where you want to configure the databases, start the **MBAM Server Configuration** wizard. You can select **MBAM Server Configuration** from the **Start** menu to open the wizard.\n\n2.  Click **Add New Features**, select **Compliance and Audit Database** and **Recovery Database**, and then click **Next**. The wizard checks that all prerequisites for the databases have been met.\n\n3.  If the prerequisite check is successful, click **Next** to continue. Otherwise, resolve any missing prerequisites, and then click **Check prerequisites again**.\n\n4.
