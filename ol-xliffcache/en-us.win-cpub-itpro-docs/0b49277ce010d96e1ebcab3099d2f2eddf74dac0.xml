For supported versions, requirements, and other planning information, see [Planning for Migrating from a Previous Version of App-V](planning-for-migrating-from-a-previous-version-of-app-v51.md).\n\n**To deploy the App-V 5.1 client and App-V 4.6 client on the same computer**\n\n1.  Install the following version of the App-V client on the computer that is running App-V 4.6.\n\n    -   [Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 Service Pack 3](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41187)\n\n2.  Install the App-V 5.1 client on the computer that is running the App-V 4.6 SP3 version of the client. For best results, we recommend that you install all available updates to the App-V 5.1 client.\n\n3.  Convert or re-sequence the packages gradually.\n\n    -   To convert the packages, use the App-V 5.1 package converter and convert the required packages to the App-V 5.1 (**.appv**) file format.\n\n    -   To re-sequence the packages, consider using the latest version of the Sequencer for best results.\n\n    For more information about publishing packages, see [How to Publish a Package by Using the Management Console](how-to-publish-a-package-by-using-the-management-console-51.md).\n\n4.  Deploy packages to the client computers.\n\n5.  Convert extension points, as needed.
