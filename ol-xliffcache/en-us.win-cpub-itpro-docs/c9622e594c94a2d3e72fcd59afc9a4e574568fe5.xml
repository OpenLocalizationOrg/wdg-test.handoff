anonymously\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting determines which communication sessions, or pipes, have attributes and permissions that allow anonymous access.\n\nRestricting access over named pipes such as COMNAP and LOCATOR helps prevent unauthorized access to the network.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   User-defined list of shared folders\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set this policy to a null value; that is, enable the policy setting, but do not enter named pipes in the text box. This will disable null session access over named pipes, and applications that rely on this feature or on unauthenticated access to named pipes will no longer function.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy | Not defined | \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Netlogon, samr, lsarpc| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Null| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Netlogon, samr, lsarpc| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes different features and tools available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nFor this policy setting to take effect, you must also enable the [Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares](network-access-restrict-anonymous-access-to-named-pipes-and-shares.md) setting.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nYou can restrict access over named pipes such as COMNAP and LOCATOR to help prevent unauthorized access to the network. The following list describes available named pipes and their purpose. These pipes were granted anonymous access in earlier versions of Windows and some legacy applications may still use them.\n\n| Named pipe | Purpose |\n| - | - |\n| COMNAP | SNABase named pipe. Systems network Architecture (SNA) is a collection of network protocols that were originally developed for IBM mainframe computers.| \n| COMNODE| SNA Server named pipe.| \n| SQL\\QUERY | Default named pipe for SQL Server.| \n| SPOOLSS | Named pipe for the Print Spooler service.| \n| EPMAPPER | End Point Mapper named pipe.| \n| LOCATOR | Remote Procedure Call Locator service named pipe.| \n| TrlWks | Distributed Link Tracking Client named pipe.| \n| TrkSvr | Distributed Link Tracking Server named pipe.| \n \n### Countermeasure\n\nConfigure the **Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously** setting to a null value (enable the setting but do not specify named pipes in the text box).\n\n### Potential impact\n\nThis configuration disables null-session access over named pipes, and applications that rely on this feature or on unauthenticated access to named pipes no longer function. This may break trust between Windows Server 2003 domains in a mixed mode environment.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
