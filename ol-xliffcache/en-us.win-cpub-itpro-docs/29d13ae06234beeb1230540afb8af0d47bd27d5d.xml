Server Management Console. When you select this node, the **Results** pane displays a list of licenses and license groups. The following license types are available:\n\n-   **Unlimited License**—Provides access for any number of simultaneous users. This method of licensing is appropriate when you want to associate an enterprise-wide license with an application.\n\n-   **Concurrent License**—Enables you to define the maximum number of concurrent users who are allowed to use the application.\n\n-   **Named License**—Enables you to assign a license to an individual user. A named license can be used to ensure that a particular user will always be able to run the application.\n\n**Note**  \nYou can combine concurrent and named licenses for the same application.\n\n \n\nRight-click the **Applications Licenses** node to display a pop-up menu that contains the following elements.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"new-unlimited-license\"></a>**New Unlimited License**  \nDisplays the New Unlimited License Wizard. This wizard consists of the following pages:\n\n1.  Enter the name of the license group in the **Applications License Group Name** field, and enter a value (in minutes) in the **License Expiration Warning** field. (You can enter any value from 0 through 100.) You can also use the up and down arrows to select the number of minutes.\n\n2.  Enter brief descriptive text in the **License Description** field, and select the **Enabled** check box to enable the license.\n\n    Optionally, you can use the **Expiration Date** field to specify an expiration date for the license. You can select the check box to use the displayed expiration date, or you can use the calendar utility to browse to the desired expiration date.\n\n3.  Click **Finish** to add the new license.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"new-concurrent-license\"></a>**New Concurrent License**  \nDisplays the New Concurrent License Wizard. This wizard consists of the following three pages and is almost identical to the New Unlimited License Wizard:\n\n1.  Enter the name of the license group in the **Applications License Group Name** field, and enter a value (in minutes) in the **License Expiration Warning** field. (You can enter any value from 0 through 100.) You can also use the up and down arrows to select the number of minutes.\n\n2.  Enter brief descriptive text in the **License Description** field, and enter a value in the **Concurrent License Quantity** field.\n\n    You can also use the up and down arrows to specify the number of concurrent licenses. Select the **Enabled** check box to enable the license.\n\n    Optionally, you can use the **Expiration Date** field to specify an expiration date for the license. You can select the check box to use the displayed expiration date, or you can use the calendar utility to browse to the desired expiration date.\n\n3.  Click **Finish** to add the new licenses.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"new-named-license\"></a>**New Named License**  \nDisplays the New Named License Wizard.

(You can enter any value from 0 through 100). You can also use the up and down arrows to select the number of minutes.\n\n2.  Enter brief descriptive text in the **License Description** field, and select the **Enabled** check box to enable the license.\n\n    Optionally, you can use the **Expiration Date** field to specify an expiration date for the license. You can select the check box to use the displayed expiration date, or you can use the calendar utility to browse to the desired expiration date.\n\n3.  Click **Add**, **Edit**, or **Remove** named users.\n\n4.
