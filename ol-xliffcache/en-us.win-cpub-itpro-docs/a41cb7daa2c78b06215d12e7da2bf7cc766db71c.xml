describes how to configure a certificate template that Active Directory Certification Services (AD CS) uses as the starting point for device certificates that are automatically enrolled and deployed to workstations in the domain. It shows how to create a copy of a template, and then configure the template according to your design requirements.\n\n**Administrative credentials**\n\n## To configure the workstation authentication certificate template and autoenrollment\nTo complete these procedures, you must be a member of both the Domain Admins group in the root domain of your forest, and a member of the Enterprise Admins group.\n\n\n1.  On the device where AD CS is installed, open the Certification Authority console.\n\n2.  In the navigation pane, right-click **Certificate Templates**, and then click **Manage**.\n\n3.  In the details pane, click the **Workstation Authentication** template.\n\n4.  On the **Action** menu, click **Duplicate Template**. In the **Duplicate Template** dialog box, select the template version that is appropriate for your deployment, and then click **OK**. For the resulting certificates to have maximum compatibility with the available versions of Windows, we recommended that you select **Windows Server 2003**.\n\n5.  On the **General** tab, in **Template display name**, type a new name for the certificate template, such as **Domain Isolation Workstation Authentication Template**.\n\n6.
