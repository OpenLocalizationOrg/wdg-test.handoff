You can use this report to determine how heavily a specific application is used.\n\nThis report generates a graph that displays the total daily usage over time during the reporting period.\n\nThis report also lists the following information:\n\n-   Number of sessions—Number of times an application was used\n\nThe Application Utilization Report also includes a summary of the total usage.\n\nWhen you create a report, you specify the parameters that are used for collecting the data when the report is run.\n\nReports are not run automatically; you must run them explicitly to generate output data. The length of time it takes to run a report is determined by the amount of data collected in the data store.\n\nAfter you run a report and the output is displayed in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can export the report into the following formats:\n\n-   Adobe Acrobat (PDF)\n\n-   Microsoft Office Excel\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Create a Report](how-to-create-a-reportserver.md)\n\n[How to Delete a Report](how-to-delete-a-reportserver.md)\n\n[How to Export a Report](how-to-export-a-reportserver.md)\n\n[How to Print a Report](how-to-print-a-reportserver.md)\n\n[How to Run a Report](how-to-run-a-reportserver.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
