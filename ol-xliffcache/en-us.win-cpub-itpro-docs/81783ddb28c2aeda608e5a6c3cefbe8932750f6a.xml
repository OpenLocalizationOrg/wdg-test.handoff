AppLocker divides the rules into four collections: executable files, Windows Installer files, scripts, and DLL files. For more info about rule collections, see [Understanding AppLocker rule collections](understanding-applocker-rule-collections.md). By default, if enforcement is not configured and rules are present in a rule collection, those rules are enforced. The following table details the three AppLocker rule enforcement settings in Group Policy for each rule collection.\n\n| Enforcement setting | Description |\n| - | - |\n| Not configured | By default, enforcement is not configured in a rule collection. If rules are present in the corresponding rule collection, they are enforced. If rule enforcement is configured in a higher-level linked Group Policy object (GPO), that enforcement value overrides the **Not configured** value.| \n| Enforce rules | Rules are enforced for the rule collection, and all rule events are audited.| \n| Audit only | Rule events are audited only. Use this value when planning and testing AppLocker rules.| \n \nFor the AppLocker policy to be enforced on a device, the Application Identity service must be running. For more info about the Application Identity service, see [Configure the Application Identity service](configure-the-application-identity-service.md).\n\nWhen AppLocker policies from various GPOs are merged, the enforcement modes are merged by using the standard Group Policy order of inheritance, which is local, domain, site, and organizational unit (OU). The Group Policy setting that was last written or applied by order of inheritance is used for the enforcement mode, and all rules from linked GPOs are applied.\n"}
