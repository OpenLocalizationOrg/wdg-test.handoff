Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Certification Services determines whether the operating system generates events when Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) operations are performed.\n\nExamples of AD CS operations include:\n\n-   AD CS starts, shuts down, is backed up, or is restored.\n\n-   Certificate revocation list (CRL)-related tasks are performed.\n\n-   Certificates are requested, issued, or revoked.\n\n-   Certificate manager settings for AD CS are changed.\n\n-   The configuration and properties of the certification authority (CA) are changed.\n\n-   AD CS templates are modified.\n\n-   Certificates are imported.\n\n-   A CA certificate is published to Active Directory Domain Services.\n\n-   Security permissions for AD CS role services are modified.\n\n-   Keys are archived, imported, or retrieved.\n\n-   The OCSP Responder Service is started or stopped.\n\nMonitoring these operational events is important to ensure that AD CS role services are functioning properly.\n\n**Event volume: Low to medium on servers that provide AD CS role services.**\n\nRole-specific subcategories are outside the scope of this document.\n\n| Computer
