Troubleshooting the ACT Configuration Wizard\n\n\n**Applies to**\n\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows 8.1\n-   Windows 8\n-   Windows 7\n-   Windows Server 2012\n-   Windows Server 2008 R2\n\nWhen you start Application Compatibility Manager (ACM) for the first time, the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) Configuration Wizard appears. The wizard helps you configure your ACT database, your shared folder for ACT log files, and your ACT Log Processing Service account.\n\n## Selecting a Configuration for ACM\n\n\nThe **Enterprise configuration** option enables all ACT functionality. You must be an administrator on the local computer to select this option.\n\nThe **View and manage reports only** option enables you to use ACM to create data-collection packages and analyze your data. You cannot access the ACT Log Processing Service. This option assumes that another computer in your organization is processing the logs and loading the compatibility data into the ACT database.\n\n## Configuring ACT Database Settings\n\n\nTo configure ACT database settings in the ACT Configuration Wizard, you must have read and write permissions to the ACT database. For more information, see [ACT Database Configuration](act-database-configuration.md). If you do not have the appropriate permissions, contact your Microsoft速 SQL Server速 administrator. For more information, see [Troubleshooting ACT Database Issues](troubleshooting-act-database-issues.md).\n\n## Configuring the ACT Log Processing Service\n\n\nIf you use the Local System account to run the ACT Log Processing Service, your user account must be an Administrator account. Your computer account *&lt;domain&gt;*\\\\*&lt;computer&gt;*$ must have read and write permissions to the ACT database.\n\nYour user account must also have **Log on as a service** permissions. For more information, see [Troubleshooting the ACT Log Processing Service](troubleshooting-the-act-log-processing-service.md).\n\n## Configuring the Share for the ACT Log Processing Service\n\n\nFor information about how to configure the share for the ACT Log Processing Service, see [ACT LPS Share Permissions](act-lps-share-permissions.md).\n\n## Changing Settings After You Finish the ACT Configuration Wizard\n\n\nIn the **Settings** dialog box in ACM, you can change some of the settings that you see in the ACT Configuration Wizard. You can also change other settings that are not available in the wizard. For more information, see [Settings for ACM](settings-for-acm.md).\n\n## Restarting the ACT Configuration Wizard\n\n\nIf you cancel the configuration process before you reach the final page of the ACT Configuration Wizard, your settings are deleted and the wizard restarts the next time that you start ACM.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Configuring ACT](configuring-act.md)\n\n[Using ACT](using-act.md)\n\n[Troubleshooting ACT](troubleshooting-act.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
