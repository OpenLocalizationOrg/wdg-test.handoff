A file with a smaller block size takes longer to stream over the network, but it is less bandwidth intensive. Files with larger block sizes might stream faster, but they use more network bandwidth. Through experimentation, you can discover the optimum block size for streaming applications on your network.\n\n \n\nThe remainder of the package properties on the **Properties** tab is automatically generated and cannot be modified on this tab.\n\n**To change the package name or comments**\n\n1.  Click the **Properties** tab.\n\n2.  In the **Package Name** text box, enter or edit the single name used for the package, which can contain multiple applications.\n\n3.  In the **Comments** text box, optionally enter or edit any comments. The suggested best practice is to provide detail information about the package and sequencing.\n\n4.  From the **File** menu, select **Save**.\n\n**To change the block size**\n\n1.  Click the **Properties** tab.\n\n2.  On the **Block Size** drop-down list, select **4 KB**, **16 KB**, **32 KB**, or **64 KB**.\n\n3.  From the **File** menu, select **Save**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[About the Properties Tab](about-the-properties-tab.md)\n\n[Sequencer Console](sequencer-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
