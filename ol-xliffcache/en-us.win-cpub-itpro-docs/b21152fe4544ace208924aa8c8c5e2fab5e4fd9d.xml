values\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the **Modify firmware environment values** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis security setting determines who can modify firmware environment values. Firmware environment values are settings that are stored in the nonvolatile RAM of non-x86-based computers. The effect of the setting depends on the processor.\n\nOn x86-based computers, the only firmware environment value that can be modified by assigning this user right is the **Last Known Good Configuration** setting, which should only be modified by the system.\n\nOn Itanium-based computers, boot information is stored in nonvolatile RAM. Users must be assigned this user right to run bootcfg.exe and to change the **Default Operating System** setting using the **Startup and Recovery** feature on the **Advanced** tab of **System Properties**.\n\nThe exact setting for firmware environment values is determined by the boot firmware. The location of these values is also specified by the firmware. For example, on a UEFI-based system, NVRAM contains firmware environment values that specify system boot settings.\n\nOn all computers, this user right is required to install or upgrade Windows.\n\nConstant: SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   User-defined list of accounts\n-   Administrators\n-   Not Defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Ensure that only the local Administrators group is assigned the **Modify firmware environment values** user right.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\User Rights Assignment\n\n### Default values\n\nBy default this setting is Administrators on domain controllers and on stand-alone servers.\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default policy values. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO |Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Adminstrators| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Adminstrators| \n| Domain Controller Effective Default Settings | Adminstrators| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Adminstrators| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Adminstrators| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features, tools, and guidance to help you manage this policy.\n\nA restart of the device is not required for this policy setting to be effective.\n\nAny change to the user rights assignment for an account becomes effective the next time the owner of the account logs on.\n\nThis security setting does not affect who can modify the system environment values and user environment values that are displayed on the **Advanced** tab of **System Properties**.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nSettings are applied in the following order through a Group Policy Object (GPO), which will overwrite settings on the local computer at the next Group Policy update:\n\n1.  Local policy settings\n2.  Site policy settings\n3.  Domain policy settings\n4.  OU policy settings\n\nWhen a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nAnyone who is assigned the **Modify firmware environment values** user right could configure the settings of a hardware component to cause it to fail, which could lead to data corruption or a denial-of-service condition.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nEnsure that only the local Administrators group is assigned the **Modify firmware environment values** user right.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nNone. Restricting the **Modify firmware environment values** user right to the members of the local Administrators group is the default configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [User Rights Assignment](user-rights-assignment.md)\n"}
