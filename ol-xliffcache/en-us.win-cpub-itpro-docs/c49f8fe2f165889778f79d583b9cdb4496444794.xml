Group policy, the MBAM Client honors it.\n\nThis Group Policy setting is called **Enforce drive encryption type on operating system drives** and is located in the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components** &gt; **BitLocker Drive Encryption** &gt; **Operating System Drives**. If you enable this policy and select the encryption type as **Used Space Only encryption**, MBAM will honor the policy and BitLocker will only encrypt disk space that is used on the volume.\n\n## How to get the MBAM Group Policy Templates and edit the settings\n\n\nWhen you are ready to configure the MBAM Group Policy settings you want, do the following:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Steps to follow</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Where to get instructions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Copy the MBAM Group Policy Templates from [How to Get MDOP Group Policy (.admx) Templates](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=393941) and install them on a computer that is capable of running the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM).</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Copying the MBAM 2.5 Group Policy Templates](copying-the-mbam-25-group-policy-templates.md)</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Configure the Group Policy settings that you want to use in your enterprise.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Editing the MBAM 2.5 Group Policy Settings](editing-the-mbam-25-group-policy-settings.md)</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Descriptions of the MBAM Group Policy settings\n\n\nThe **MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)** GPO node contains four global policy settings and four child GPO nodes: **Client Management**, **Fixed Drive**, **Operating System Drive**, and **Removable Drive**.
