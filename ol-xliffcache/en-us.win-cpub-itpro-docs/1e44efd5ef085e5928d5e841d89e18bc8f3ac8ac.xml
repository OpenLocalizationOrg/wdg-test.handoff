hardware\nms.prod: w10\nms.mktglfcycl: manage\nms.sitesec: library\nms.pagetype: devices, surface\nauthor: miladCA\n---\n\n#Manage Surface UEFI settings\n\nCurrent and future generations of Surface devices, including Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, use a unique UEFI firmware engineered by Microsoft specifically for these devices. This firmware allows for significantly greater control of the device’s operation over firmware versions in earlier generation Surface devices, including the support for touch, mouse, and keyboard operation. By using the Surface UEFI settings you can easily enable or disable internal devices or components, configure security to protect UEFI settings from being changed, and adjust the Surface device boot settings. \n\n>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface Pro 3, Surface 3, Surface Pro 2, Surface 2, Surface Pro, and Surface do not use the Surface UEFI and instead use firmware provided by third-party manufacturers, such as AMI.\n\nYou can enter the Surface UEFI settings on your Surface device by pressing the **Volume Up** button and the **Power** button simultaneously. Hold the **Volume Up** button until the Surface logo is displayed, which indicates that the device has begun to boot. \n\n##PC information \n\nOn the **PC information** page, detailed information about your Surface device is provided: \n\n- **Model** – Your Surface device’s model will be displayed here, such as Surface Book or Surface Pro 4. The exact configuration of your device is not shown, (such as processor, disk size, or memory size). \n- **UUID** – This Universally Unique Identification number is specific to your device and is used to identify the device during deployment or management. \n\n- **Serial Number** – This number is used to identify this specific Surface device for asset tagging and support scenarios.\n- **Asset Tag** – The asset tag is assigned to the Surface device with the [Asset Tag Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44076). \n\nYou will also find detailed information about the firmware of your Surface device. Surface devices have several internal components that each run different versions of firmware. The firmware version of each of the following devices is displayed on the **PC information** page (as shown in Figure 1): \n\n- System UEFI \n\n- SAM Controller \n\n- Intel Management Engine \n\n- System Embedded Controller \n\n- Touch Firmware \n\n![System information and firmware version information](images/manage-surface-uefi-figure-1.png \"System information and firmware version information\")\n\n*Figure 1. System information and firmware version information*\n\nYou can find up-to-date information about the latest firmware version for your Surface device in the [Surface Update History](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/surface-update-history) for your device. \n\n##Security \n\nOn the **Security** page of Surface UEFI settings, you can set a password to protect UEFI settings. This password must be entered when you boot the Surface device to UEFI. The password can contain the following characters (as shown in Figure 2): \n\n- Uppercase letters: A-Z \n\n- Lowercase letters: a-z \n\n- Numbers: 1-0 \n\n- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()?<>{}[]-_=+|.,;:’`” \n\nThe password must be at least 6 characters and is case sensitive. \n\n![Add a password to protect Surface UEFI settings](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig2.png \"Add a password to protect Surface UEFI settings\")\n\n*Figure 2. Add a password to protect Surface UEFI settings*\n\nOn the **Security** page you can also change the configuration of Secure Boot on your Surface device. Secure Boot technology prevents unauthorized boot code from booting on your Surface device, which protects against bootkit and rootkit-type malware infections. You can disable Secure Boot to allow your Surface device to boot third-party operating systems or bootable media. You can also configure Secure Boot to work with third-party certificates, as shown in Figure 3. Read more about [Secure Boot](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/secure-boot-overview) in the TechNet Library.\n\n![Configure Secure Boot](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig3.png \"Configure Secure Boot\")\n\n*Figure 3. Configure Secure Boot*\n\nYou can also enable or disable the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) device on the **Security** page, as shown in Figure 4. The TPM is used to authenticate encryption for your device’s data with BitLocker. Read more about [BitLocker](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/keep-secure/bitlocker-overview) in the TechNet Library. \n\n![Configure Surface UEFI security settings](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig4.png \"Configure Surface UEFI security settings\")\n\n*Figure 4. Configure Surface UEFI security settings*\n\n##Devices \n\nOn the **Devices** page you can enable or disable specific devices and components of your Surface device. Devices that you can enable or disable on this page include: \n\n- Docking and USB Ports \n\n- MicroSD or SD Card Slot \n\n- Rear Camera \n\n- Front Camera \n\n- Infrared (IR) Camera \n\n- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \n\n- Onboard Audio (Speakers and Microphone) \n\nEach device is listed with a slider button that you can move to **On** (enabled) or **Off** (disabled) position, as shown in Figure 5. \n\n![Enable and disable specific devices](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig5.png \"Enable and disable specific devices\")\n\n*Figure 5. Enable and disable specific devices*\n\n##Boot configuration \n\nOn the **Boot Configuration** page, you can change the order of your boot devices and/or enable or disable boot of the following devices: \n\n- Windows Boot Manager \n\n- USB Storage \n\n- PXE Network \n\n- Internal Storage \n\nYou can boot from a specific device immediately, or you can swipe left on that device’s entry in the list using the touchscreen. You can also boot immediately to a USB device or USB Ethernet adapter when the Surface device is powered off by pressing the **Volume Down** button and the **Power** button simultaneously. \n\nFor the specified boot order to take effect, you must set the **Enable Alternate Boot Sequence** option to **On**, as shown in Figure 6. \n\n![Configure the boot order for your Surface device](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig6.png \"Configure the boot order for your Surface device\")\n\n*Figure 6. Configure the boot order for your Surface device* \n\nYou can also turn on and off IPv6 support for PXE with the **Enable IPv6 for PXE Network Boot** option, for example when performing a Windows deployment using PXE where the PXE server is configured for IPv4 only.  \n\n##About \n\nThe **About** page displays regulatory information, such as compliance with FCC rules, as shown in Figure 7. \n\n![Regulatory information displayed on the About page](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig7.png \"Regulatory information displayed on the About page\")\n\n*Figure 7. Regulatory information displayed on the About page*\n\n##Exit \n\nUse the **Restart Now** button on the **Exit** page to exit UEFI settings, as shown in Figure 8. \n\n![Exit Surface UEFI and restart the device](images/manage-surface-uefi-fig8.png \"Exit Surface UEFI and restart the device\")\n\n*Figure 8. Click Restart Now to exit Surface UEFI and restart the device*\n"}
