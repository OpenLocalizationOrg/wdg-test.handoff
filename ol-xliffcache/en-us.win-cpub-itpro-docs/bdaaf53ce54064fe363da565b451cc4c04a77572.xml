under special sign on (or log on) circumstances.\n\nThis subcategory allows you to audit events generated by special logons such as the following:\n\n-   The use of a special logon, which is a logon that has administrator-equivalent privileges and can be used to elevate a process to a higher level.\n\n-   A logon by a member of a Special Group. Special Groups enable you to audit events generated when a member of a certain group has logged on to your network. You can configure a list of group security identifiers (SIDs) in the registry. If any of those SIDs are added to a token during logon and the subcategory is enabled, an event is logged.\n\n**Event volume**:\n\n-   Low on a client computer.\n\n-   Medium on a domain controllers or network servers.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | This subcategory is very important because of [Special Groups](http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2008/03/11/special-groups-auditing-via-group-policy-preferences.aspx) related events, you must enable this subcategory for Success audit if you use this feature.<br>At the same time this subcategory allows you to track account logon sessions to which sensitive privileges were assigned.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n| Member Server     | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | This subcategory is very important because of [Special Groups](http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2008/03/11/special-groups-auditing-via-group-policy-preferences.aspx) related events, you must enable this subcategory for Success audit if you use this feature.<br>At the same time this subcategory allows you to track account logon sessions to which sensitive privileges were assigned.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n| Workstation       | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | This subcategory is very important because of [Special Groups](http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2008/03/11/special-groups-auditing-via-group-policy-preferences.aspx) related events, you must enable this subcategory for Success audit if you use this feature.<br>At the same time this subcategory allows you to track account logon sessions to which sensitive privileges were assigned.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4964](event-4964.md)(S): Special groups have been assigned to a new logon.\n\n-   [4672](event-4672.md)(S): Special privileges assigned to new logon.\n\n"}
