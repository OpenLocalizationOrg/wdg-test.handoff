Experience Virtualization (UE-V) 2.0, 2.1, and 2.1 SP1 Agent lets you synchronize users’ application and Windows settings with the settings storage location. The *Sync Method* configuration defines how the UE-V Agent uploads and downloads those settings to the settings storage location. UE-V 2.x introduces a new SyncMethod called the *SyncProvider*. For more information about trigger events that start the synchronization of application and Windows settings, see [Sync Trigger Events for UE-V 2.x](sync-trigger-events-for-ue-v-2x-both-uevv2.md).\n\n## SyncMethod Configuration\n\n\nThis table explains the changes to SyncMethod from UE-V v1.0 to v2.0 to v2.1, as well as the settings for each configuration:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>SyncMethod Configuration</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>V1.0</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>V2.0</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>V2.1 and V2.1 SP1</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SyncProvider</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>n/a</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Default</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Default</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Settings changes for a specific application or for global Windows desktop settings are saved locally to a cache folder.
