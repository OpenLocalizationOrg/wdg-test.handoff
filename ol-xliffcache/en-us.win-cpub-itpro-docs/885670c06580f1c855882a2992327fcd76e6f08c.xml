Application Virtualization Security Guide\n\n\nThis Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) security guide provides instructions for administrators who are responsible for configuring the security features that were selected for the App-V deployment.\n\n**Note**  \nThis documentation does not provide guidance for choosing the specific security options. That information is provided in the App-V Security Best Practices white paper available at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=127120>.\n\n \n\nAs an App-V administrator using this guide, you should be familiar with the following security-related technologies:\n\n-   Active Directory Domain Services\n\n-   Public key infrastructure (PKI)\n\n-   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)\n\n-   Group Policies\n\n-   Internet Information Services (IIS)\n\n## APP-V Infrastructure Components\n\n\nWhen planning an enhanced security App-V environment, you can consider several different infrastructure models.\n\n**Note**  \nFor more information about App-V infrastructure models, see the following documentation:\n\n-   [App-V Planning and Deployment Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122063)\n\n-   [Infrastructure Planning and Design Guide Series](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151986)\n\n \n\nThese models utilize some but possibly not all of the App-V components depicted in the following illustration.\n\n![app-v branch office diagram](images/appvbranchoffices.gif)\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization--app-v--management-server\"></a>Application Virtualization (App-V) Management Server  \nThe App-V Management Server streams the package content and publishes the shortcuts and file-type associations to the App-V Client. The App-V Management Server also supports active upgrade, license management, and a database that can be used for reporting.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization--app-v--streaming-server\"></a>Application Virtualization (App-V) Streaming Server  \nThe App-V Streaming Server hosts the packages for streaming to App-V Clients in environments such as branch offices, where the bandwidth of the connection to the App-V Management Server is insufficient for streaming package content to clients. The Streaming Server contains only streaming functionality and does not provide you with the App-V Management Console or the App-V Management Web Service.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization--app-v--data-store\"></a>Application Virtualization (App-V) Data Store  \nThe App-V data store, in the SQL database, retains information related to the App-V infrastructure. The information in the App-V data store includes all application records, application assignments, and which groups manage the Application Virtualization environment.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization--app-v--management-service\"></a>Application Virtualization (App-V) Management Service  \nThe App-V Management Service communicates read/write requests to the Application Virtualization data store. This component can be installed on the same computer as the App-V Management Server or on a separate computer with IIS installed.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization--app-v--management-console\"></a>Application Virtualization (App-V) Management Console  \nThe App-V Management Console is a snap-in management utility for App-V Server administration.

The output of the Sequencer consists of the application icon, the OSD file containing application definition information, a package manifest file, and an SFT file containing the application’s content files. Optionally, a Windows Installer file can be created for installing the package without using the App-V infrastructure.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization--app-v--client\"></a>Application Virtualization (App-V) Client  \nThe App-V Client is installed on the App-V Desktop Client computer or on the App-V Terminal Services Client computer. It provides the virtual environment for the virtual application packages. The App-V Client manages the package streaming to the cache, virtual application publishing refresh, and interaction with the Application Virtualization Servers.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
