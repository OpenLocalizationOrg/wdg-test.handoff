Implementing a Basic Firewall Policy Design\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview\n\nThis parent checklist includes cross-reference links to important concepts about the basic firewall policy design. It also contains links to subordinate checklists that will help you complete the tasks that are required to implement this design.\n\n>**Note:**  Complete the tasks in this checklist in order. When a reference link takes you to a procedure, return to this topic after you complete the steps in that procedure so that you can proceed with the remaining tasks in this checklist.\n\nThe procedures in this section use the Group Policy MMC snap-in interfaces to configure the GPOs, but you can also use Windows PowerShell. For more info, see [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Administration with Windows PowerShell](windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-administration-with-windows-powershell.md).\n\n **Checklist: Implementing a basic firewall policy design**\n\n| Task | Reference |\n| - | - |\n| Review important concepts and examples for the basic firewall policy design to determine if this design meets the needs of your organization. | [Identifying Your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Deployment Goals](identifying-your-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-deployment-goals.md)<br/>[Basic Firewall Policy Design](basic-firewall-policy-design.md)<br/>[Firewall Policy Design Example](firewall-policy-design-example.md)<br/>[Planning Settings for a Basic Firewall Policy](planning-settings-for-a-basic-firewall-policy.md)| \n| Create the membership group and a GPO for each set of devices that require different firewall rules.
