service data\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the **Synchronize directory service data** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting determines which users and groups have authority to synchronize all directory service data, regardless of the protection for objects and properties. This privilege is required to use LDAP directory synchronization (dirsync) services. Domain controllers have this user right inherently because the synchronization process runs in the context of the **System** account on domain controllers.\n\nConstant: SeSyncAgentPrivilege\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   User-defined list of accounts\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Ensure that no accounts are assigned the **Synchronize directory service data** user right. Only domain controllers need this privilege, which they inherently have.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\User Rights Assignment\n\n### Default values\n\nBy default this setting is not defined on domain controllers and on stand-alone servers.\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default policy values. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Domain Controller Effective Default Settings | Enabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features, tools, and guidance to help you manage this policy.\n\nA restart of the device is not required for this policy setting to be effective.\n\nAny change to the user rights assignment for an account becomes effective the next time the owner of the account logs on.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nSettings are applied in the following order through a Group Policy Object (GPO), which will overwrite settings on the local computer at the next Group Policy update:\n\n1.  Local policy settings\n2.  Site policy settings\n3.  Domain policy settings\n4.  OU policy settings\n\nWhen a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nThe **Synchronize directory service data** user right affects domain controllers (only domain controllers should be able to synchronize directory service data). Domain controllers have this user right inherently because the synchronization process runs in the context of the **System** account on domain controllers. Attackers who have this user right can view all information that is stored within the directory. They could then use some of that information to facilitate additional attacks or expose sensitive data, such as direct telephone numbers or physical addresses.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nEnsure that no accounts are assigned the **Synchronize directory service data** user right.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nNone. Not defined is the default configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [User Rights Assignment](user-rights-assignment.md)\n"}
