The topics in this section provide the information required to install the Application Virtualization Servers and the other Application Virtualization System components.\n\n**Note**  \nThe procedures in this section take you through a customized installation, where you pick and choose components to install on separate computers, as recommended in a production environment. However, your operating procedures might dictate a different approach, and during the installation process you might want to group components together. Regardless of where you install the components, you can install them in any order.\n\n \n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-application-virtualization-management-server\"></a>[How to Install Application Virtualization Management Server](how-to-install-application-virtualization-management-server.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step procedure for installing the Application Virtualization Management Server and assigning it to the appropriate server group.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-the-application-virtualization-streaming-server\"></a>[How to Install the Application Virtualization Streaming Server](how-to-install-the-application-virtualization-streaming-server.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step procedure for installing the Application Virtualization Streaming Server and assigning it to the appropriate server group.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-the-management-web-service\"></a>[How to Install the Management Web Service](how-to-install-the-management-web-service.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step procedure for installing the Application Virtualization Management Web Service on a target computer on your network.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-the-management-console\"></a>[How to Install the Management Console](how-to-install-the-management-console.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step procedure for installing the Application Virtualization Management Console on a target computer on your network.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-a-database\"></a>[How to Install a Database](how-to-install-a-database.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step procedure for installing a database for your server-based deployment of Application Virtualization, if a database is not already available.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-remove-the-application-virtualization-system-components\"></a>[How to Remove the Application Virtualization System Components](how-to-remove-the-application-virtualization-system-components.md)  \nProvides step-by-step procedures to remove all or selected Application Virtualization software components from a target computer.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Server-Based Scenario Overview](application-virtualization-server-based-scenario-overview.md)\n\n[How to Configure Servers for Server-Based Deployment](how-to-configure-servers-for-server-based-deployment.md)\n\n[How to Upgrade the Servers and System Components](how-to-upgrade-the-servers-and-system-components.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
