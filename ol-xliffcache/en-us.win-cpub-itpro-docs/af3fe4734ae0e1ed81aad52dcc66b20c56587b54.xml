Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) with the Configuration Manager Integration topology. This topology integrates MBAM with System Center Configuration Manager. To deploy MBAM with the Stand-alone topology, see [High-Level Architecture of MBAM 2.5 with Stand-alone Topology](high-level-architecture-of-mbam-25-with-stand-alone-topology.md).\n\nFor a list of the supported versions of the software mentioned in this topic, see [MBAM 2.5 Supported Configurations](mbam-25-supported-configurations.md).\n\n**Important**  \nWindows To Go is not supported for the Configuration Manager Integration topology installation when you are using Configuration Manager 2007.\n\n \n\n## Recommended number of servers and supported number of clients\n\n\nThe recommended number of servers and supported number of clients in a production environment is as follows:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Recommended architecture</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Number of servers and other computers</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Three servers</p>\n<p>One workstation</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Number of client computers supported</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>500,000</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Differences between Configuration Manager Integration and Stand-alone topologies\n\n\nThe main differences between the topologies are:\n\n-   The compliance and reporting features are removed from MBAM and are accessed from Configuration Manager.\n\n-   Reports are viewed from the Configuration Manager Management Console, with the exception of the Recovery Audit Report, which you continue to view from the MBAM Administration and Monitoring Website.\n\n## Recommended MBAM high-level architecture with the Configuration Manager Integration topology\n\n\nThe following diagram and table describe the recommended high-level architecture for MBAM with the Configuration Manager Integration topology. MBAM multi-forest deployments require a one-way or two-way trust. One-way trusts require that the server domain trusts the client domain.\n\n![mbam2\\-5](images/mbam2-5-cmserver.png)\n\nServer\nFeatures to configure on this server\nDescription\nDatabase Server\n\nRecovery Database\n\nThis feature is configured on a computer running Windows Server and supported SQL Server instance.\n\nThe **Recovery Database** stores recovery data that is collected from MBAM Client computers.\n\nAudit Database\n\nThis feature is configured on a computer running Windows Server and supported SQL Server instance.\n\nThe **Audit Database** stores audit activity data that is collected from client computers that have accessed recovery data.\n\nReports\n\nThis feature is configured on a computer running Windows Server and supported SQL Server instance.\n\nThe **Reports** provide recovery audit data for the client computers in your enterprise. You can view reports from the Configuration Manager console or directly from SQL Server Reporting Services.\n\nConfiguration Manager Primary Site Server\n\nSystem Center Configuration Manager Integration feature\n\n-   This feature is configured on the Configuration Manager Primary Site Server, which is the top-tier server in your Configuration Manager infrastructure.\n\n-   The **Configuration Manager Server** collects the hardware inventory information from client computers and is used to report BitLocker compliance of client computers.\n\n-   When you run the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring Setup wizard to install the server software, the MBAM Supported Computers collection, configuration baseline, and reports are configured on the Configuration Manager Primary Site Server.\n\n-   The **Configuration Manager console** must be installed on the same computer on which you install the MBAM Server software.\n\nAdministration and Monitoring Server\n\nAdministration and Monitoring Website\n\nThis feature is configured on a computer running Windows Server.\n\nThe **Administration and Monitoring Website** is used to:\n\n-   Help end users regain access to their computers when they are locked out. (This area of the Website is commonly called the Help Desk.)\n\n-   View the Recovery Audit Report, which shows recovery activity for client computers. Other reports are viewed from the Configuration Manager console.\n\nSelf-Service Portal\n\nThis feature is configured on a computer running Windows Server.\n\nThe **Self-Service Portal** is a website that enables end users on client computers to independently log on to a website to get a recovery key if they lose or forget their BitLocker password.\n\nMonitoring web services for this website\n\nThis feature is installed on a computer running Windows Server.\n\nThe **monitoring web services** are used by the MBAM Client and the websites to communicate to the database.\n\n**Important**  \nThe Monitoring Web Service is no longer available in Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 SP1 since the MBAM Client and the websites communicate directly with the Recovery Database.\n\n \n\nManagement Workstation\n\nMBAM Group Policy Templates\n\n-   The **MBAM Group Policy Templates** are Group Policy settings that define implementation settings for MBAM, which enable you to manage BitLocker drive encryption.\n\n-   Before you run MBAM, you must download the Group Policy Templates from [How to Get MDOP Group Policy (.admx) Templates](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=393941) and copy them to a server or workstation that is running a supported Windows Server or Windows operating system.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The workstation does not have to be a dedicated computer.\n\n     \n\nMBAM Client and Configuration Manager Client computer\n\nMBAM Client software\n\nThe **MBAM Client**:\n\n-   Uses Group Policy Objects to enforce BitLocker drive encryption on client computers in the enterprise.\n\n-   Collects the BitLocker recovery key for three data drive types: operating system drives, fixed data drives, and removable (USB) data drives.\n\n-   Collects recovery information and computer information about the client computers.\n\nConfiguration Manager Client\n\nThe **Configuration Manager Client** enables Configuration Manager to collect hardware compatibility data about the client computers and report compliance information.\n\n \n\n## Differences in MBAM deployment for supported Configuration Manager versions\n\n\nWhen you deploy MBAM with the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you can install MBAM on a primary site server.
