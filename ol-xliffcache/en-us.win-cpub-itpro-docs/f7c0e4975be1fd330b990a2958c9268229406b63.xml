All MBAM Server features can be installed on a single server or distributed across multiple servers. Generally, we recommend that you use a three-server or five-server configuration for production environments, although configurations of two or four servers can also be used, depending on your computing needs.\n\n**Note**  \nFor more information about performance scalability of MBAM and recommended deployment topologies, see the MBAM Scalability and High-Availability Guide white paper at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=258314>.\n\n \n\nEach MBAM feature has specific prerequisites. For a full list of server feature prerequisites and hardware and software requirements, see [MBAM 1.0 Deployment Prerequisites](mbam-10-deployment-prerequisites.md) and [MBAM 1.0 Supported Configurations](mbam-10-supported-configurations.md).\n\nIn addition to the server-related MBAM features, the server Setup application includes an MBAM Group Policy template. This template can be installed on any computer that is able to run the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM).\n\n## Order of deployment of MBAM Server Features\n\n\nWhen you deploy the MBAM Server features, install the features in the following order:\n\n1.  Recovery and Hardware Database\n\n2.  Compliance and Audit Database\n\n3.  Compliance Audit and Reports\n\n4.  Administration and Monitoring Server\n\n5.  Policy Template\n\n**Note**  \nKeep track of the names of the computers on which you install each feature. You will use this information throughout the installation process. You can print and use a deployment checklist to assist you in the installation process. For more information about the MBAM deployment checklist, see [MBAM 1.0 Deployment Checklist](mbam-10-deployment-checklist.md).\n\n \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Planning to Deploy MBAM 1.0](planning-to-deploy-mbam-10.md)\n\n[Deploying the MBAM 1.0 Server Infrastructure](deploying-the-mbam-10-server-infrastructure.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
