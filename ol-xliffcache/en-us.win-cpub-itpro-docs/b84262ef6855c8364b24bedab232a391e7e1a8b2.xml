migrates the settings and components specified in [What Does USMT Migrate?](usmt-what-does-usmt-migrate.md) To include additional files and settings, we recommend that you create a custom .xml file

By creating a custom .xml file, you can keep your changes separate from the default .xml files, which makes it easier to track your modifications.\n\nIn this topic:\n\n[Migrate a Single Registry Key](#bkmk-migsingleregkey)\n\n[Migrate a Specific Folder](#bkmk-migspecificfolder)\n\n[Migrate a Folder from a Specific Drive](#bkmk-migfoldspecdrive)\n\n[Migrate a Folder from Any Location](#bkmk-migfolderanyloc)\n\n[Migrate a File Type Into a Specific Folder](#bkmk-migfiletypetospecificfolder)\n\n[Migrate a Specific File](#bkmk-migspecificfile)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-migsingleregkey\"></a> Migrate a Single Registry Key\n\n\nThe following .xml file migrates a single registry key.\n\n``` syntax\n<migration urlid=\"http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/migxmlext/test\">\n     <component type=\"Application\" context=\"System\">\n          <displayName>Component to migrate only registry value string</displayName> \n          <role role=\"Settings\">\n          <rules>\n               <include>\n                    <objectSet>\n                         <pattern type=\"Registry\">HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Cache [Persistent]</pattern> \n                    </objectSet>\n               </include>\n          </rules>\n          </role>\n     </component>\n</migration>\n```\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-migspecificfolder\"></a>Migrate a Specific Folder\n\n\nThe following examples show how to migrate a folder from a specific drive, and from any location on the computer.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-migfoldspecdrive\"></a> Migrate a Folder from a Specific Drive\n\n-   **Including subfolders.** The following .xml file migrates all files and subfolders from C:\\\\EngineeringDrafts to the destination computer.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    <migration urlid=\"http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/migxmlext/test\">\n    <component type=\"Documents\" context=\"System\">\n      <displayName>Component to migrate all Engineering Drafts Documents including subfolders</displayName>\n      <role role=\"Data\">\n        <rules>\n          <include>\n            <objectSet>\n              <pattern type=\"File\">C:\\EngineeringDrafts\\* [*]</pattern>\n            </objectSet>\n          </include>\n        </rules>\n      </role>\n    </component>\n    </migration>\n    ```\n\n-   **Excluding subfolders.** The following .xml file migrates all files from C:\\\\EngineeringDrafts, but it does not migrate any subfolders within C:\\\\EngineeringDrafts.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    <migration urlid=\"http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/migxmlext/test\">\n    <component type=\"Documents\" context=\"System\">\n      <displayName>Component to migrate all Engineering Drafts Documents without subfolders</displayName>\n      <role role=\"Data\">\n        <rules>\n          <include>\n            <objectSet>\n              <pattern type=\"File\"> C:\\EngineeringDrafts\\ [*]</pattern>\n            </objectSet>\n          </include>\n        </rules>\n      </role>\n    </component>\n    </migration>\n    ```\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-migfolderanyloc\"></a>Migrate a Folder from Any Location\n\nThe following .xml file migrates all files and subfolders of the EngineeringDrafts folder from any drive on the computer.
