## Manage Minecraft Education Edition

### Access to Windows Store for Business
By default, when a teacher with a work or school account in your edu tenant acquires Minecraft: Education Edition, they are automatically signed up for Window Store for Business, and the **Basic Purchaser** role is assigned to them. 
            **Basic Purchaser** role allows teachers to acquire Minecraft: Education Edition and to distribute it to students. 

However, tenant admins can control whether or not teachers automatically sign up for Windows Store for Business, and get the **Basic Purachaser** role. You can configure this with the **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Windows Store for Business.** You'll find this on the **Permissions** page. 

To prevent educators from automatically signing up for Windows Store for Business
1.  In Windows Store for Business, click **Settings**, and then click **Permissions**. 

    ![Permission page for Windows Store for Business](images/minecraft-admin-permissions.png)

2. Click **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Windows Store for Business.**

### Roles and permissions

- View the Minecraft product description page 
- Acquire and manage the app
- Info on Support page (including links to documentation and access to support through customer service)

## Private store

These apps will automatically be in your private store:
- Word mobile
