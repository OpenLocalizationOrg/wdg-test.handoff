Form a project team that can clearly articulate deployment issues in a vision statement. When you write your vision statement, identify, clarify, and refine your deployment goals. Prioritize and, if possible, combine your deployment goals so that you can design and deploy Windows Firewall with Advanced Security by using an iterative approach. You can take advantage of the predefined Windows Firewall with Advanced Security deployment goals presented in this guide that are relevant to your scenarios.\n\nThe following table lists the three main tasks for articulating, refining, and subsequently documenting your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security deployment goals.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Deployment goal tasks</th>\n<th>Reference links</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Evaluate predefined Windows Firewall with Advanced Security deployment goals that are provided in this section of the guide, and combine one or more goals to reach your organizational objectives.</p></td>\n<td><p>Predefined deployment goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>[Protect Devices from Unwanted Network Traffic](protect-devices-from-unwanted-network-traffic.md)</p></li>\n<li><p>[Restrict Access to Only Trusted Devices](restrict-access-to-only-trusted-devices.md)</p></li>\n<li><p>[Require Encryption When Accessing Sensitive Network Resources](require-encryption-when-accessing-sensitive-network-resources.md)</p></li>\n<li><p>[Restrict Access to Sensitive Resources to Only Specified Users or Devices](restrict-access-to-only-specified-users-or-devices.md)</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>Map one goal or a combination of the predefined deployment goals to an existing Windows Firewall with Advanced Security design.</p></td>\n<td><ul>\n<li><p>[Mapping Your Deployment Goals to a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Design](mapping-your-deployment-goals-to-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design.md)</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Based on the status of your current infrastructure, document your deployment goals for your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security design into a deployment plan.</p></td>\n<td><ul>\n<li><p>[Designing A Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy](designing-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-strategy.md)</p></li>\n<li><p>[Planning Your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Design](planning-your-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-design.md)</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n**Next:**  [Protect Devices from Unwanted Network Traffic](protect-devices-from-unwanted-network-traffic.md)\n"}
