If the validation fails, you may need to provide the domain and user name.\n\nUsing the credentials provided, we will try to discover the SIP address. If a SIP address can't be found, then Skype for Business will use the UPN as the SIP address. If this is not the SIP address for the account, you will need to provide the SIP address.\n\nThe Exchange server address will need to be provided if the device can't find a server associated with the login credentials. Microsoft Surface Hub will use the Exchange server to talk to ActiveSync, which enables several key features on the device.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Manage Microsoft Surface Hub](manage-surface-hub.md)\n\n[Microsoft Surface Hub administrator's guide](surface-hub-administrators-guide.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
