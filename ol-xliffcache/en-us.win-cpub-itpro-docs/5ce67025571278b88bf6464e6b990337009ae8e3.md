# Windows Installer rules in AppLocker

This topic describes the file formats and available default rules for the Windows Installer rule collection.

AppLocker defines Windows Installer rules to include only the following file formats:

-   .msp
-   .mst

The purpose of this collection is to allow you to control the installation of files on client computers and servers through Group Policy or the Local Security Policy snap-in. The following table lists the default rules that are available for the Windows Installer rule collection.

| Purpose | Name | User | Rule condition type |
| - | - | - | - |
| Allow members of the local Administrators group to run all Windows Installer files| (Default Rule) All Windows Installer files| BUILTIN\Administrators| Path: *|

| Allow all users to run Windows Installer files that are located in the Windows Installer folder | (Default Rule) All Windows Installer files in %systemdrive%\Windows\Installer| Everyone| Path: %windir%\Installer\*|
