10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Network access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting determines what additional permissions are granted for anonymous connections to the device. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous users can enumerate the names of domain accounts and shared folders and perform certain other activities. This capability is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust.\n\nBy default, the token that is created for anonymous connections does not include the Everyone SID. Therefore, permissions that are assigned to the Everyone group do not apply to anonymous users.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n\n    The Everyone SID is added to the token that is created for anonymous connections, and anonymous users can access any resource for which the Everyone group has been assigned permissions.\n\n-   Disabled\n\n    The Everyone SID is removed from the token that is created for anonymous connections.\n\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set this policy to **Disabled**.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Polices\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy.
