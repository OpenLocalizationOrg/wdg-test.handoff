Perform the following steps on each reference computer that you used to define the AppLocker policy. The device does not need to be joined to the domain.\n\nMembership in the local **Administrators** group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure.\n\n**To determine which apps are digitally signed on a reference device**\n1.  Run **Get-AppLockerFileInformation** with the appropriate parameters.\n\n    The **Get-AppLockerFileInformation** cmdlet retrieves the AppLocker file information from a list of files or from an event log. File information that is retrieved can include publisher information, file hash information, and file path information. File information from an event log may not contain all of these fields. Files that are not signed do not have any publisher information.\n\n2.  Analyze the publisher's name and digital signature status from the output of the command.\n\nFor command parameters, syntax, and examples, see [Get-AppLockerFileInformation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee460961.aspx).\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Use a reference device to create and maintain AppLocker policies](use-a-reference-computer-to-create-and-maintain-applocker-policies.md)\n \n \n"}
