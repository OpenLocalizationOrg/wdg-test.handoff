from a Previous Version of App-V\n\n\nUse the following information to plan how to migrate to Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.1 from previous versions of App-V.\n\n## Migration requirements\n\n\nBefore you start any upgrades, review the following requirements:\n\n-   If you are upgrading from a version earlier than App-V 4.6 SP2, upgrade to version App-V 4.6 SP3 first before upgrading to App-V 5.1 or later. In this scenario, upgrade the App-V clients first, and then upgrade the server components.  \n**Note:** App-V 4.6 has exited Mainstream support.\n\n-   App-V 5.1 supports only packages that are created using App-V 5.0 or App-V 5.1, or packages that have been converted to the **.appv** format.\n\n-   If you are upgrading the App-V Server from App-V 5.0 SP1, see [About App-V 5.1](about-app-v-51.md#bkmk-migrate-to-51) for instructions.\n\n## Running the App-V 5.1 client concurrently with App-V 4.6\n\n\nYou can run the App-V 5.1 client concurrently on the same computer with the App-V 4.6 SP3 client.\n\nWhen you run coexisting App-V clients, you can:\n\n-   Convert an App-V 4.6 SP3 package to the App-V 5.1 format and publish both packages, when you have both clients running.\n\n-   Define the migration policy for the converted package, which allows the converted App-V 5.1 package to assume the file type associations and shortcuts from the App-V 4.6 package.\n\n### Supported coexistence scenarios\n\nThe following table shows the supported App-V coexistence scenarios. We recommend that you install the latest available updates of a given release when you are running coexisting clients.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">App-V 4.6 client type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">App-V 5.1 client type</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>App-V 4.6 SP3</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>App-V 5.1</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>App-V 4.6 SP3 RDS</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>App-V 5.1 RDS</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### Requirements for running coexisting clients\n\nTo run coexisting clients, you must:\n\n-   Install the App-V 4.6 client before you install the App-V 5.1 client.\n\n-   Enable the **Enable Migration Mode** Group Policy setting, which is in the **App-V** &gt; **Client Coexistence** node. To deploy the .admx template, see [How to Download and Deploy MDOP Group Policy (.admx) Templates](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn659707.aspx).\n\n**Note**  \nApp-V 5.1 packages can run side by side with App-V 4.6 packages if you have coexisting installations of App-V 5.1 and 4.6. However, App-V 5.1 packages cannot interact with App-V 4.6 packages in the same virtual environment.\n\n \n\n### Client downloads and documentation\n\nThe following table provides links to the App-V 4.6 client downloads and to the TechNet documentation about the releases. The downloads include the App-V “regular” and RDS clients. The TechNet documentation about the App-V client applies to both clients, unless stated otherwise.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">App-V version</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Link to TechNet documentation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>App-V 4.6 SP3</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[About Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 SP3](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn511019.aspx)</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>App-V 4.6 SP3</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[About Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.1](about-app-v-51.md)</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nFor more information about how to configure App-V 5.1 client coexistence, see:\n\n-   [How to Deploy the App-V 4.6 and the App-V 5.1 Client on the Same Computer](how-to-deploy-the-app-v-46-and-the-app-v--51-client-on-the-same-computer.md)\n\n-   [App-V 5.0 Coexistence and Migration](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows/jj835811.aspx)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"converting--previous-version--packages-using-the-package-converter-\"></a>Converting “previous-version” packages using the package converter\n\n\nBefore migrating a package, created using App- 4.6 SP2 or earlier, to App-V 5.1, review the following requirements:\n\n-   You must convert the package to the **.appv** file format.\n\n-   The Package Converter supports only the direct conversion of packages that were created by using App-V 4.5 and later. To use the package converter on a package that was created using a previous version, you must use an App-V 4.5 or later version of the sequencer to upgrade the package, and then you can perform the package conversion.\n\nFor more information about using the package converter to convert a package, see [How to Convert a Package Created in a Previous Version of App-V](how-to-convert-a-package-created-in-a-previous-version-of-app-v51.md). After you convert the file, you can deploy it to target computers that run the App-V 5.1 client.\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization).
