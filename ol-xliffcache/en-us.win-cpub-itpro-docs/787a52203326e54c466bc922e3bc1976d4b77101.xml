Success audits generate an audit entry when a user successfully accesses an Active Directory object that has a SACL specified. Failure audits generate an audit entry when a user unsuccessfully attempts to access an Active Directory object that has a SACL specified. To set this value to **No auditing,** in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the **Define these policy settings** check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.\n> **Note:**  You can set a SACL on an Active Directory object by using the **Security** tab in that object's **Properties** dialog box. This is the same as Audit object access, except that it applies only to Active Directory objects and not to file system and registry objects.\n \n**Default:**\n\n-   Success on domain controllers.\n-   Undefined for a member server.\n\n## Configure this audit setting\n\nYou can configure this security setting under Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Audit Policy.\n\nThere is only one directory service access event, which is identical to the Object Access security event message 566.\n\n| Directory service access events | Description                            |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 566                             | A generic object operation took place. |\n \n## Related topics\n\n- [Basic security audit policy settings](basic-security-audit-policy-settings.md)\n \n \n"}
