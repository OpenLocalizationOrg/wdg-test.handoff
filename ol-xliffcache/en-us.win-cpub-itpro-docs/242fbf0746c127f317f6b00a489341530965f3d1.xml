You can configure the App-V Management Server through the App-V Management Console. However, the App-V Streaming Server is managed through the registry. In either case, the certificate must include the proper *extended key usage* (EKU) for Server authentication and the Network Service must have read access to the private key.\n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-management-server-security-post-installation\"></a>[How to Configure Management Server Security Post-Installation](how-to-configure-management-server-security-post-installation.md)  \nProvides a procedure that can be performed post-installation, using the App-V Management Console, to add the certificate and configure the App-V Management Server for enhanced security.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-streaming-server-security-post-installation\"></a>[How to Configure Streaming Server Security Post-Installation](how-to-configure-streaming-server-security-post-installation.md)  \nProvides a procedure that can be performed post-installation, to add the certificate and configure the App-V Streaming Server for enhanced security.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"troubleshooting-certificate-permission-issues\"></a>[Troubleshooting Certificate Permission Issues](troubleshooting-certificate-permission-issues.md)  \nProvides troubleshooting guidance for when the private key has not been configured with the proper ACL for the Network Service.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
