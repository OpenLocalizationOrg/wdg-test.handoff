When AppLocker policy enforcement is set to **Audit only**, rules are only evaluated but all events generated from that evaluation are written to the AppLocker log.\n\nThere is no audit mode for the DLL rule collection. DLL rules affect specific apps. Therefore, test the impact of these rules first before deploying them to production.\n\nTo enforce AppLocker rules by configuring an AppLocker policy to **Enforce rules**, see [Configure an AppLocker policy for enforce rules](configure-an-applocker-policy-for-enforce-rules.md).\n\n>**Caution:**  AppLocker rules will be enforced immediately on the local device or when the Group Policy object (GPO) is updated by performing this procedure. If you want to see the effect of applying an AppLocker policy before setting the enforcement setting to **Enforce rules**, configure the policy to **Audit only**. For info about how to do this, see [Configure an AppLocker policy for audit only](configure-an-applocker-policy-for-audit-only.md)or [Test an AppLocker policy by Using Test-AppLockerPolicy](test-an-applocker-policy-by-using-test-applockerpolicy.md).\n \n \n \n"}
