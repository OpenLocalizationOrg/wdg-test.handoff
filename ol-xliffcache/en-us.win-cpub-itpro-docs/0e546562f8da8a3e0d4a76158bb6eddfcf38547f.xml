As with the App-V Management Server, a certificate must be correctly provisioned with the correct EKU identifier for Server Authentication before you complete the following post-installation procedure.\n\n**To configure Streaming Server security post-installation**\n\n1.  Create an MMC, add the **Certificates** snap-in, and select **Local Machine certificate store**.\n\n2.  Open the **Personal** certificates for the computer, and open the certificate provisioned for App-V.\n\n3.  On the **Details** tab, scroll down to the thumbprint and copy the hash in the details pane.\n\n4.  Open the registry editor, and navigate to `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Distribution server`.\n\n5.  Edit the `X509CertHash` value, paste the thumbprint hash in the value field, and remove all spaces. Click **OK** to accept the edit.\n\n6.  In the registry editor, navigate to `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Distribution server\\RtspsPorts`.\n\n7.  Create a new **DWORD** value named \"322,\" and then enter the decimal value as 322 or the hexadecimal value as 142.\n\n8.  Restart the streaming service.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Configure Management Server Security Post-Installation](how-to-configure-management-server-security-post-installation.md)\n\n[Troubleshooting Certificate Permission Issues](troubleshooting-certificate-permission-issues.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
