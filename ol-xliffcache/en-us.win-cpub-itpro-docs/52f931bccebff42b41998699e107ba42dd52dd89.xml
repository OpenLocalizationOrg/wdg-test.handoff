(DaRT) 8.0 in your environment. To get the DaRT software, see [How to Get MDOP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=322049). It is assumed that you are installing all functionality on one administrator computer. If you need to deploy or uninstall DaRT 8.0 on multiple computers, using an electronic software distribution system, for example, it might be easier to use command line installation options. Descriptions and examples of the available command line options are provided in this section.\n\n**Important**  \nBefore you install DaRT, see [DaRT 8.0 Supported Configurations](dart-80-supported-configurations-dart-8.md) to ensure that you have installed all of the prerequisite software and that the computer meets the minimum system requirements. The computer onto which you install DaRT must be running Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.\n\n \n\nYou can install DaRT using one of two different configurations:\n\n-   Install DaRT and all of the DaRT tools on the administrator computer.\n\n-   Install on the administrator computer only the tools that you need to create the DaRT recovery image, and then install the **Remote Connection Viewer** and, optionally, **Crash Analyzer** on a help desk computer.\n\nThe DaRT installation file is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Install the version that matches the architecture of the computer on which you are running the DaRT Recovery Image wizard, not the computer architecture of the recovery image that you are creating.\n\nYou can use either version of the DaRT installation file to create a recovery image for either 32-bit or 64-bit computers, but you cannot create one recovery image for both 32-bit and 64-bit computers.\n\n**To install DaRT and all DaRT tools on an administrator computer**\n\n1.  Download the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the DaRT 8.0 installer file. Choose the architecture that matches the computer on which you are installing DaRT and running the DaRT Recovery Image wizard.\n\n2.  From the folder into which you downloaded DaRT 8.0, run the **MSDaRT80.msi** installation file that corresponds to your system requirements.\n\n3.  On the **Welcome to the Microsoft DaRT 8.0 Setup Wizard** page, click **Next**.\n\n4.  Accept the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then click **Next**.\n\n5.  On the **Microsoft Update** page, select **Use Microsoft Update when I check for updates**, and then click **Next**.\n\n6.  On the **Select Installation Folder** page, select a folder, or click **Next** to install DaRT in the default installation location.\n\n7.  On the **Setup Options** page, select the DaRT features that you want to install, or click **Next** to install DaRT with all of the features.\n\n8.  To start the installation, click **Install**.\n\n9.  After the installation has completed successfully, click **Finish** to exit the wizard.\n\n## To install DaRT and all DaRT tools on an administrator computer by using a command prompt\n\n\nWhen you install or uninstall DaRT, you have the option of running the installation files at the command prompt. This section describes some examples of different options that you can specify when you install or uninstall DaRT at the command prompt.\n\nThe following example shows how to install all DaRT functionality.\n\n``` syntax\nmsiexec /i MSDaRT80.msi ADDLOCAL=CommonFiles, DaRTRecoveryImage,CrashAnalyzer,RemoteViewer \n```\n\nThe following example shows how to install only the DaRT Recovery Image wizard.\n\n``` syntax\nmsiexec /i MSDaRT80.msi ADDLOCAL=CommonFiles, ,DaRTRecoveryImage\n```\n\nThe following example shows how to install only the Crash Analyzer and the DaRT Remote Connection Viewer.\n\n``` syntax\nmsiexec /i MSDaRT80.msi ADDLOCAL=CommonFiles,CrashAnalyzer,RemoteViewer \n```\n\nThe following example creates a setup log for the Windows Installer. This is valuable for debugging.\n\n``` syntax\nmsiexec.exe /i MSDaRT80.msi /l*v log.txt \n```\n\n**Note**  \nYou can add /qn or /qb to perform a silent installation.\n\n \n\n**To validate the DaRT installation**\n\n1.  Click **Start**, and select **Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset**.\n\n    The **Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset** window opens.\n\n2.  Check that all of the DaRT tools that you selected for installation were successfully installed.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Deploying DaRT 8.0 to Administrator Computers](deploying-dart-80-to-administrator-computers-dart-8.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
