Copy all prerequisite applications and the MED-V workspace package files to a shared drive or to a DVD. The following is a list of the required applications and files.\n\n    -   **Windows Virtual PC**. For more information, see [Configure Installation Prerequisites](configure-installation-prerequisites.md).\n\n    -   **Windows Virtual PC Additions and Updates**. For more information, see [Configure Installation Prerequisites](configure-installation-prerequisites.md).\n\n    -   **MED-V Host Agent Installation File** – installs the Host Agent (MED-V\\_HostAgent\\_Setup installation file).\n\n        **Warning**  \n        Close Internet Explorer before you install the MED-V Host Agent, otherwise conflicts can occur later with URL redirection. You can also do this by specifying a computer restart during a distribution.\n\n         \n\n    -   **MED-V Workspace Installer, VHD, and Setup Executable** – created with the **MED-V Workspace Packager**. For more information, see [Create a MED-V Workspace Package](create-a-med-v-workspace-package.md).\n\n        **Important**  \n        The compressed VHD file (.medv) and the Setup executable program (setup.exe) must be in the same folder as the MED-V workspace installer.\n\n         \n\n2.  Install the following in the order listed. The end user can perform this task manually or you can create a script to install the following:\n\n    -   Windows Virtual PC and the Windows Virtual PC additions and updates. A computer restart is required.\n\n    -   The MED-V Host Agent.\n\n        **Note**  \n        If it is running, Internet Explorer must be restarted before the installation of the MED-V Host Agent can finish.\n\n         \n\n    -   The MED-V workspace package.\n\n        Install the MED-V workspace by running the setup.exe program that is included in the MED-V workspace package files.\n\n3.  Complete first time setup.\n\n    After the MED-V workspace is installed, you have the option of starting MED-V. This starts the MED-V Host Agent. You can either start MED-V at that time, or start the MED-V Host Agent later to complete first time setup.\n\n    To start the MED-V Host Agent, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization**, and then click **MED-V Host Agent**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Deploy a MED-V Workspace Through an Electronic Software Distribution System](how-to-deploy-a-med-v-workspace-through-an-electronic-software-distribution-system.md)\n\n[How to Deploy a MED-V Workspace in a Windows 7 Image](how-to-deploy-a-med-v-workspace-in-a-windows-7-image.md)\n\n[Deploying the MED-V Workspace Package](deploying-the-med-v-workspace-package.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
