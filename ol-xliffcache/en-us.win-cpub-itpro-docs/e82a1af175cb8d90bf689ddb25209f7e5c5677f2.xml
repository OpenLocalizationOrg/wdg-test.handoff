If a firewall rule is missing, then the user does not receive any kind of warning, the network traffic is silently blocked, and the program might fail.\n\nWe recommend that you do not enable these settings until you have created and tested the required rules.\n\n**Administrative credentials**\n\nTo complete these procedures, you must be a member of the Domain Administrators group, or otherwise be delegated permissions to modify the GPOs.\n\n## To configure Windows Firewall to suppress the display of a notification for a blocked program and to ignore locally defined rules\n\n1.  [Open the Group Policy Management Console to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](open-the-group-policy-management-console-to-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security.md).\n\n2.  In the details pane, in the **Overview** section, click **Windows Firewall Properties**.\n\n3.  For each network location type (Domain, Private, Public), perform the following steps.\n\n    1.  Click the tab that corresponds to the network location type.\n\n    2.  Under **Settings**, click **Customize**.\n\n    3.  Under **Firewall settings**, change **Display a notification** to **No**.\n\n    4.  Under **Rule merging**, change **Apply local firewall rules** to **No**.\n\n    5.  Although a connection security rule is not a firewall setting, you can also use this tab to prohibit locally defined connection security rules if you are planning to deploy IPsec rules as part of a server or domain isolation environment. Under **Rule merging**, change **Apply local connection security rules** to **No**.\n\n    6.  Click **OK** twice.\n"}
