This information includes daily usage information for a specific application or all applications, and system error tracking.\n\n**Note**  \n-   During installation, the installation script installs only the English language version of report viewer. For the report viewer to display the correct information in other languages, it is necessary to install a language pack from the following location: <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131645>.\n\n-   When you add or edit an application in the Server Management Console, you must make sure that the application names and versions exactly match those in the OSD files. The reporting feature uses the application names and versions data fields when it identifies application usage data on which to report. If the data fields do not match, the usage records will be skipped.\n\n \n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"application-virtualization-report-types\"></a>[Application Virtualization Report Types](application-virtualization-report-types.md)  \nContains information about the available report types.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-create-a-report\"></a>[How to Create a Report](how-to-create-a-reportserver.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step process for creating a report.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-run-a-report\"></a>[How to Run a Report](how-to-run-a-reportserver.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step process for running a report.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-print-a-report\"></a>[How to Print a Report](how-to-print-a-reportserver.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step process for printing a report.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-export-a-report\"></a>[How to Export a Report](how-to-export-a-reportserver.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step process for exporting a report.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-delete-a-report\"></a>[How to Delete a Report](how-to-delete-a-reportserver.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step process for deleting a report.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Utilization Report](application-utilization-reportserver.md)\n\n[How to Perform Administrative Tasks in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console](how-to-perform-administrative-tasks-in-the-application-virtualization-server-management-console.md)\n\n[Software Audit Report](software-audit-reportserver.md)\n\n[System Error Report](system-error-reportserver.md)\n\n[System Utilization Report](system-utilization-reportserver.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
