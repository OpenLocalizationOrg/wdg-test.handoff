Alternatively, you can use the GPMC to view the links to a GPO from the **Scope** tab.\n\n### AGPM displays an error if you click the Back button from the Change, Repair, or Remove AGPM Client dialog box\n\nIf you browse to **Programs and Features** in Control Panel and then select **Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management – Client**, AGPM displays an error if you click **Modify** and then click the **Back** button in the **Change, Repair, or Remove AGPM Client** dialog box.\n\n**Workaround:** Click **Cancel** to clear the error, and then start the process again. Do not click the **Back** button after you click **Modify** .\n\n### Comment fails to appear in the History window when the Approver deploys a GPO and enters a comment\n\nIf a user who has the Editor role submits a request to deploy a GPO, and the user who has the Approver role then deploys the GPO and enters a comment, the comment fails to appear in the **History** window.\n\n**Workaround:** None.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Advanced Group Policy Management](index.md)\n\n[What's New in AGPM 4.0 SP3](whats-new-in-agpm-40-sp3.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
