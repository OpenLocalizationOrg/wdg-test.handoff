Because this product can affect every computer in your organization, you might disrupt your entire network if you do not plan your deployment carefully. However, if you plan your deployment carefully and manage it so that it meets your business needs, MBAM can help reduce your administrative overhead and total cost of ownership.\n\nIf you are new to this product, we recommend that you read the documentation thoroughly. Before you deploy it to a production environment, we also recommend that you validate your deployment plan in a test network environment. You might also consider taking a class about relevant technologies.
