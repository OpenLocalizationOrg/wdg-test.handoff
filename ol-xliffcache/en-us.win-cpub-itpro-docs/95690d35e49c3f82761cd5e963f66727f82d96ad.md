# Manage Microsoft Surface Hub


How to manage your Surface Hub after finishing the first-run program.

## Introduction


After initial setup of Microsoft Surface Hub, the device’s settings and configuration can be modified or changed in several ways:

-   Local management: using the Settings app on the device
-   Remote management: using a mobile device management (MDM) solution, like Microsoft Intune, AirWatch, or System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.

For locally-managed devices, administrator credentials are required to use the Settings app. These can be login credentials for Active Directory, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), or a local admin account. One of these will have been selected during first run (see [Set up admins for this device](first-run-program-surface-hub.md#setup-admins)).

For remotely-managed devices, the device must be enrolled into an MDM solution, either during first run or in the Settings app.

Be aware that the two management methods are not mutually exclusive—every device will have the capability to be locally managed, and devices can be remotely managed if you choose.

>
            **Note**  If a device is remotely managed, then any changes to local settings that are also remotely managed will only persist until the next time your Surface Hub syncs with your MDM solution. Once a sync occurs, the settings and policies defined on your MDM solution will be pushed to the device, overwriting the local changes.

 

## Surface Hub-only settings


Surface Hubs have many settings that are common to other Windows devices, but also have settings which are only configurable on Surface Hubs.

## Which should I choose?


If you plan to deploy multiple Surface Hubs, we recommend that you manage your devices remotely. This requires that your organization use an MDM solution to deploy policies.

Every Surface Hub can be managed locally by an admin who physically logs in to the device. Which method is used to log in is decided during first run (see [Set up admins for this device](first-run-program-surface-hub.md#setup-admins)).
