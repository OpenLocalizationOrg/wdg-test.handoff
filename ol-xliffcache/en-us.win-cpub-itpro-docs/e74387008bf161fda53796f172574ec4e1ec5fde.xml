Shutdown: Allow system to be shut down without having to log on\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Shutdown: Allow system to be shut down without having to log on** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting determines whether a device can be shut down without having to log on to Windows. If you enable this policy setting, the **Shut Down** option is available on the logon screen in Windows. If you disable this policy setting, the **Shut Down** option is removed from the logon screen. This configuration requires that users are able to log on to the device successfully and that they have the **Shut down the system** user right before they can perform a shutdown.\n\nUsers who can access the console locally can shut down the system. Attackers or misguided users can connect to the server by using Remote Desktop Services, and then shut it down or restart it without having to identify themselves. A malicious user might also cause a temporary denial-of-service \ncondition by walking up to the local console and restarting the server, or shutting down the server and thus rendering unavailable all its applications and services.\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n\n    The shut down command is available on the logon screen.\n\n-   Disabled\n\n    The shut down option is removed from the logon screen and users must have the **Shut down the system** user right before they can perform a shutdown.\n\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n1.  On servers, set this policy to **Disabled**. You must log on to servers to shut them down or restart them.\n2.  On client devices, set this policy to **Enabled** and define the list of those with the right to shut them down or restart them with the User Rights Assignment policy **Shut down the system**.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Enabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a computer restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nFor info about the User Rights Assignment policy, **Shut down the system**, see [Shut down the system](shut-down-the-system.md).\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nUsers who can access the console locally could shut down the device\n\nAttackers who have access to the local console could restart the server, which would cause a temporary DoS condition. Attackers could also shut down the server and leave all of its applications and services unavailable.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nDisable the **Shutdown: Allow system to be shut down without having to log on** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nYou must log on to servers to shut them down or restart them.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
