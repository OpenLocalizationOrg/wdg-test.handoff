There are four supported methods that you can use to deploy the DaRT recovery image.\n\n-   Burn the ISO image file to a CD or DVD\n\n-   Save the contents of the ISO image file to a USB Flash Drive (UFD)\n\n-   Extract the boot.wim file from the ISO image and deploy as a remote partition that is available to end-user computers\n\n-   Extract the boot.wim file from the ISO image and deploy in the recovery partition of a new Windows 7 installation\n\n**Important**  \nThe **DaRT Recovery Image Wizard** only provides the option to burn a CD or DVD. All other methods of saving and deploying the recovery image require additional steps that involve tools that are not included in DaRT.
