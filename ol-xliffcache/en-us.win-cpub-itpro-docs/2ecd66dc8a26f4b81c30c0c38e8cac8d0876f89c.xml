When you select this node, the **Results** pane displays a list of applications.\n\n**Note**  \nWhen you load or unload a package, all the applications in the package are loaded into or removed from cache. When loading a package, if you do not have adequate space in cache to load the applications, increase your cache size. For more information about cache size, see [How to Change the Cache Size and the Drive Letter Designation](how-to-change-the-cache-size-and-the-drive-letter-designation.md).\n\n \n\n**To load an application**\n\n1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Load** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  The application is automatically loaded. The progress is tracked in the column labeled **Package Status**. You must refresh the view to see that the load is complete or to see the progress.\n\n**To unload an application**\n\n1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Unload** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  The application is automatically unloaded, and the **Package Status** column is updated to reflect the change.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Change the Cache Size and the Drive Letter Designation](how-to-change-the-cache-size-and-the-drive-letter-designation.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
