Organizations value these apps because they solve problems unique to each business.\n\nWhen you sideload an app, you deploy a signed app package to a device. You maintain the signing, hosting, and deployment of these apps. Sideloading was also available with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1\n\nIn Windows 10, sideloading is different than in earlier versions of Windows:\n\n-   You can unlock a device for sideloading using an enterprise policy, or through **Settings**\n\n-   License keys are not required\n\n-   Devices do not have to be joined to a domain\n\n## Requirements\nHere's what you'll need to have:\n\n-   Devices need to be unlocked for sideloading (unlock policy enabled)\n\n-   Certificate assigned to app\n\n-   Signed app package\n\nAnd here's what you'll need to do:\n\n-   Turn on sideloading - you can push a policy with an MDM provider, or you can use **Settings**.\n\n-   Trust the app - import the security certificate to the local device.\n\n-   Install the app - use PowerShell to install the app package.\n\n## How do I sideload an app on desktop\nYou can sideload apps on managed or unmanaged devices.\n\n**To turn on sideloading for managed devices**\n\n-   Deploy an enterprise policy.\n\n**To turn on sideloading for unmanaged devices**\n\n1.
