Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To delete a controlled GPO**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab, click the **Controlled** tab to display the controlled GPOs.\n\n3.  Right-click the GPO you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.\n\n    -   To delete the GPO from the archive while leaving the deployed version of the GPO untouched in the production environment, click **Delete GPO from archive only**.\n\n    -   To delete the GPO from both the archive and production environment, click **Delete GPO from archive and production**.\n\n4.  Type a comment to be displayed in the audit trail for the GPO, and then click **OK**.\n\n5.  When the **Progress** window indicates that overall progress is complete, click **Close**. The GPO is removed from the **Controlled** tab and is displayed on the **Recycle Bin** tab, where it can be restored or destroyed. If the GPO was deleted only from the archive, it is also displayed on the **Uncontrolled** tab.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Approver or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Delete GPO** permissions for the GPO.\n\n-   To delete an uncontrolled GPO from the production environment without first controlling it, in the **Group Policy Management Console**, click **Forest**, click **Domains**, click **&lt;MyDomain&gt;**, and then click **Group Policy Objects**. Right-click the uncontrolled GPO, and then click **Delete**.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Deleting, Restoring, or Destroying a GPO](deleting-restoring-or-destroying-a-gpo-agpm30ops.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
