# Editing a GPO


A Group Policy Object (GPO) must be controlled by Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) before you can edit it. See [Creating or Controlling a GPO](creating-or-controlling-a-gpo-agpm40-ed.md) for more information about controlling a GPO.

To make changes to a GPO offline without immediately impacting the deployed copy of the GPO in the production environment, check out a copy of the GPO from the archive. When changes are complete, check the GPO back into the archive, test it, and request deployment of the GPO to the production environment.
