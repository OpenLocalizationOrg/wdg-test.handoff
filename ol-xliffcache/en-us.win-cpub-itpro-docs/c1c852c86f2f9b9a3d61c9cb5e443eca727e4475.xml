These issues do not appear in the product documentation and in some cases might contradict existing product documentation. Whenever possible, these issues will be addressed in later releases.\n\n### Guidance for installing or upgrading clients to App-V 4.5 CU1 using setup.msi\n\nWhen installing or upgrading your App-V clients to App-V 4.5 CU1 by using setup.msi, the prerequisites are not installed automatically.\n\nWORKAROUND   You must manually install the prerequisites before installing or upgrading the App-V client to 4.5 CU1. For detailed procedures for installing the prerequisites and the App-V client, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144106>.\n\nWhen this has been completed, install the App-V 4.5 CU1 client by using setup.msi with elevated privileges. This file is available on the App-V 4.5 CU1 release media in the Installers\\\\Client folder.\n\nWhen installing Microsoft Application Error Reporting, use the following command if you are installing or upgrading to the App-V 4.5 CU1 Desktop client:\n\n    msiexec /i dw20shared.msi APPGUID={FE495DBC-6D42-4698-B61F-86E655E0796D}  allusers=1 reboot=suppress REINSTALL=all REINSTALLMODE=vomus\n\nAlternatively, if you are installing or upgrading to the App-V 4.5 CU1 Terminal Services client, use the following command:\n\n    msiexec /i dw20shared.msi APPGUID={8A97C241-D92A-47DC-B360-E716C1AAA929} allusers=1 reboot=suppress REINSTALL=all REINSTALLMODE=vomus\n\n**Note**  \nThe APPGUID parameter references the product code of the App-V client that you install or upgrade to. The product code is unique for each setup.msi. You can use the Orca database editor or similar tool to examine Windows Installer files and determine the product code. This step is required for all installs or upgrades to App-V 4.5 CU1.\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"some-applications-might-fail-to-install-during-the-monitoring-phase-when-sequencing-on-windows-7-beta--\"></a>Some applications might fail to install during the monitoring phase when sequencing on Windows 7 Beta\n\nWhen sequencing on Windows 7 Beta or on a computer with Windows Installer 5.0, some applications might fail to install during the monitoring phase.\n\nWORKAROUND   You must manually grant the Everyone group Full Control permissions to the following registry key:\n\n    HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\SoftGrid\\\\4.5\\\\SystemGuard\n\n**Important**  \nYou must use the **Advanced** button to set the “Include inheritable permissions from this object’s parent” option.\n\n \n\n### Unable to save packages when sequencing on Windows 7 Beta\n\nWhen sequencing on Windows 7 Beta, you might be unable to save your sequenced package because of a sharing violation.\n\nWORKAROUND   As specified in the best practices section of the Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.5 Sequencing Guide (see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144108>), you must shutdown and disable the following software programs before you begin sequencing:\n\n-   Windows Defender\n\n-   Antivirus software\n\n-   Disk defragmentation software\n\n-   Windows Search\n\n-   Any open Windows Explorer session\n\nIn addition, if you have Microsoft Update running on the sequencing station to capture updates during the package update process, you will need to add “C:\\\\Windows\\\\SoftwareDistribution” as a VFS exclusion before you start sequencing.\n\n### Improving performance when sequencing the .NET Framework\n\nWhen sequencing the .NET Framework, you might experience reduced system performance because the Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN service attempts to precompile assemblies as a background task.\n\nWORKAROUND   When sequencing the .NET Framework, disable the Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN service (mscorsvw.exe) after completing the monitoring phase. You must use the **Virtual Services** tab in the Sequencer and change the startup type to disabled.\n\n### Interoperability issues with the Windows 7 Taskbar\n\nWhen you run the Application Virtualization Client on Windows 7, the Windows 7 taskbar does not collapse multiple instances of a virtual application into a single taskbar button. In addition, jump Lists do not appear when you right-click a taskbar button of a virtual application, unless the application has been pinned to the Windows 7 taskbar.\n\n### When you uninstall the Microsoft Application Virtualization Client, user settings associated with the user performing the uninstall will be deleted\n\nWhen you uninstall the Microsoft Application Virtualization Client, the Windows Installer will remove Application Virtualization settings from the current user's profile. If your computer uses roaming profiles, do not use your personal network account to uninstall the client because it will remove settings for your virtual applications on all of your computers.\n\nWORKAROUND   You should perform the App-V Client uninstall with an administrative account that is not used for running virtual applications.\n\n### Edits made on the virtual file system and virtual registry tabs must be saved while running the Sequencing wizard\n\nIf you open a package to perform an upgrade or have already run the Sequencing wizard with a new package and you make changes to the package in the virtual file system or virtual registry tabs, those changes are not automatically saved.\n\nWORKAROUND   Save the changes before re-running the wizard, to ensure that they are reflected inside the wizard’s virtual environment.\n\n### Command-line Sequencer must be run from an elevated command prompt\n\nWhen you use the command-line Sequencer, it does not prompt for elevation.\n\nWORKAROUND   Run the command-line Sequencer using an elevated command prompt.\n\n### Server Management Console configuration in distributed environments\n\nIf you need to install management components onto systems other than the primary Application Virtualization publishing and streaming server, the server install supports installing our management console and Web service on separate servers from the primary Application Virtualization Server when properly configured.\n\nTo distribute the management components across multiple servers, Kerberos delegation must be enabled on the server where the Web service is installed.\n\n### Short path variable names in OSD files can cause errors\n\nIf you receive error 450478-1F702339-0000010B “The directory name is invalid” when starting a virtual application on the client, it is possible that the variable in the OSD is set incorrectly. This can happen if the application’s installer sets a short path name during sequencing.\n\nWORKAROUND   Remove the trailing tilde from any CSIDL variable that exists in the OSD file.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"correct-syntax-for-decodepath-parameter-for-command-line-sequencer-\"></a>Correct syntax for DECODEPATH parameter for command-line Sequencer\n\nIn the command-line Sequencer, when opening a package for upgrade and decoding it to the root of the Q drive, the syntax for the *DECODEPATH* parameter should not include a trailing slash.\n\nWORKAROUND   You can use **Q:** rather than **Q:\\\\** (omitting the trailing “\\\\” character).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"when-upgrading-4-2-packages--you-encounter-problems-caused-by-windows-installer-files-in-the-virtual-file-system-\"></a>When upgrading 4.2 packages, you encounter problems caused by Windows Installer files in the Virtual File System\n\nWhen upgrading a package from 4.2, you might experience issues relating to a mismatch of Windows Installer system files that were included by default in 4.2 and the Windows Installer libraries locally installed on your Sequencing workstation. The following files are located in CSIDL\\_SYSTEM\\\\:\n\ncabinet.dll\n\nmsi.dll\n\nmsiexec.exe\n\nmsihnd.dll\n\nmsimsg.dlll\n\nWORKAROUND   Delete all of the preceding files from the package. Delete the mappings on the **VFS** tab as well as the actual files in the CSIDL\\_SYSTEM folder in your decode path.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"on-windows-xp--client-install-logging-is-not-enabled-by-default-\"></a>On Windows XP, client install logging is not enabled by default\n\nWhen installing the client, to ensure that any install errors are captured for troubleshooting purposes, you should enable logging by using the command line.\n\nWORKAROUND   Add the parameter */l\\*vx! log.txt* to the command line, as shown in the following example:\n\nsetup.exe /s /v”/qn /l\\*vx! log.txt”\n\nmsiexec.exe /i setup.msi /qn /l\\*vx! log.txt\n\nAlternatively, you can set the registry key to the following value:\n\n\\[HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Installer\\] \"Logging\"=\"voicewarmupx!\"\n\n### For Kerberos authentication to work, Service Principal Names (SPNs) must be registered for IIS\n\nWhen using IIS 6.0 or 7.0 for icon or OSD file retrieval and streaming of packages, for Kerberos authentication to be enabled, the SPNs must be registered as follows:\n\n-   On the IIS server, run the following commands by using the SETSPN.EXE Resource Kit tool. The server fully qualified domain name (FQDN) must be used.\n\n    Setspn -r SOFTGRID/&lt;Server FQDN&gt;\n\n    Setspn -r HTTP/&lt;Server FQDN&gt;\n\nFor more information, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131407>.\n\n### On upgrade from RC, the default permissions on client logs do not allow for non-admin users to access the logs for troubleshooting and support\n\nThe default permissions on client logs for the Application Virtualization RC client did not allow for non-admin access to log files, and manual changes to these log permissions were reverted when clients were restarted. This has been corrected in the RTM release for new client installs, but on upgrade from RC, the custom permissions on existing log files are not reset. However, when any new logs are created or after a log reset, the files will have the new default permissions.\n\nWORKAROUND   After the upgrade, reset existing client logs or manually change their permissions.\n\n### .NET compatibility changes\n\nMicrosoft Application Virtualization Cumulative Update 1 supports sequencing the .NET Framework on Windows XP (SP2 or later). Sequencing routines for .NET applications that were written for SoftGrid 4.2 might need to be updated when used with the App-V 4.5 Sequencer. For details and workarounds, please refer to the Knowledge Base article at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123412>.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"after-client-upgrade-from-app-v-4-2--some-applications-are-not-shown-\"></a>After client upgrade from App-V 4.2, some applications are not shown\n\nCheck for the following error in the log: ”The Application Virtualization Client could not parse the OSD file”. The Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.5 client filters out applications that have an OSD file containing an empty OS tag (&lt;OS&gt;&lt;/OS&gt;).\n\nWORKAROUND   Delete the empty OS tag from the OSD file.\n\n### The App-V server requires exemptions in its firewall for certain processes\n\nFor the server to stream applications correctly, the server's core processes, including the dispatcher, need access through the firewall.\n\nWORKAROUND   Set exemptions in the server's firewall for the following processes: sghwsvr.exe and sghwdsptr.exe. This applies to the App-V Management Server and App-V Streaming Server.\n\n### Sequencing packages that require new Visual Basic runtimes might fail\n\nIf you sequence a package that uses a newer version of a Visual Basic (VB) runtime on a system where an older version of the VB runtime is installed, you might see a crash or other unexpected behavior when you try to use your package. For example, if you try to sequence Microsoft Money 2007, which uses version 6.00.9782 of the VB runtime, on a Windows XP system with version 6.00.9690 of the VB runtime, you might see a crash in the Invoice Designer when you try to run it on another Windows XP system with that older VB runtime.\n\nWORKAROUND   After installing the application on the sequencing computer, while still monitoring, copy the correct (newer) VB runtime to the directory in the package from where the executable is started. This allows the sequenced application to find the expected version of the VB runtime when it is started.\n\n**Important**  \nThis issue has been fixed in Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.5 Cumulative Update 1.\n\n \n\n### When the server installer is run in silent mode, it does not correctly check for MSXML6\n\nThe App-V Management Server depends on MSXML6. However, if you run the installer in silent mode—for example, by using the command “msiexec -i setup.msi /qn” on a system where MSXML6 is not already installed—the installer does not notice the missing dependency and installs anyway. The most common result is that when clients attempt to refresh publishing information from the App-V Management Server, they will see failures.\n\nWORKAROUND   Verify that MSXML6 is installed on the system before attempting a silent install of the App-V Management Server.\n\n### Error code 000C800 when attempting to connect to the Application Virtualization Management Console\n\nAn Application Virtualization administrator who is not a local admin on the Application Virtualization Management Service server will receive an error (Error code: 000C800) when attempting to connect to the Application Virtualization Management Console, and the sftmmc.log entry will indicate that access to SftMgmt.udl is denied. To successfully connect to the Application Virtualization Management Console, an Application Virtualization administrator who is not a local admin on the Application Virtualization Management Service server must have at least read and execute access to the SftMgmt.udl file.\n\nThe Application Virtualization administrators must be given read and execute permissions to the SftMgmt.UDL file under %systemdrive%\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft System Center App Virt Management Server\\\\App Virt Management Service.\n\n### Client installer command-line parameters are ignored when used in conjunction with KEEPCURRENTSETTINGS=1\n\nWhen used in conjunction with KEEPCURRENTSETTINGS=1, the following client installer command-line parameters are ignored: SWICACHESIZE, MINFREESPACEMB, ALLOWINDEPENDENTFILESTREAMING, APPLICATIONSOURCEROOT, ICONSOURCEROOT, OSDSOURCEROOT, SYSTEMEVENTLOGLEVEL, SWIGLOBALDATA, DOTIMEOUTMINUTES, SWIFSDRIVE, AUTOLOADTARGET, AUTOLOADTRIGGERS, SWIUSERDATA, and REQUIRESECURECONNECTION.\n\nWORKAROUND   If you have settings you want to retain, use KEEPCURRENTSETTINGS=1 and then set the other parameters after deployment. The App-V ADM Template can be used to set the following client settings: APPLICATIONSOURCEROOT, ICONSOURCEROOT, OSDSOURCEROOT, AUTOLOADTARGET, AUTOLOADTRIGGERS, DOTIMEOUTMINUTES, and ALLOWINDEPENDENTFILESTREAMING. The ADM Template can be found at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121835>.\n\n### Error initializing virtual applications with Symantec Endpoint Protection\n\nWhen using Symantec Endpoint Protection with the Application and Device Control feature enabled, virtual applications might fail to start, with the error “The application failed to initialize properly (0xc000007b)”. For details and workarounds, please refer to the Knowledge Base article at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125851>.\n\n**Important**  \nThis issue has been fixed in Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.5 Cumulative Update 1.\n\n \n\n## Release Notes Copyright Information\n\n\nInformation in this document, including URL and other Internet Web site references, is subject to change without notice, and is provided for informational purposes only.
