policy change\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDetermines whether to audit every incident of a change to user rights assignment policies, audit policies, or trust policies.\n\nIf you define this policy setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, audit failures, or not audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when a change to user rights assignment policies, audit policies, or trust policies is successful. Failure audits generate an audit entry when a change to user rights assignment policies, audit policies, or trust policies fails.\n\nTo set this value to **No auditing**, in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the **Define these policy settings** check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.\n\n**Default:**\n\n-   Success on domain controllers.\n-   No auditing on member servers.\n\n## Configure this audit setting\n\nYou can configure this security setting under Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Audit Policy.\n\n| Policy change events | Description |\n| - | - |\n| 608 | A user right was assigned.| \n| 609 | A user right was removed. |\n| 610 | A trust relationship with another domain was created.| \n| 611 | A trust relationship with another domain was removed.| \n| 612 | An audit policy was changed.| \n| 613 | An Internet Protocol security (IPSec) policy agent started.| \n| 614 | An IPSec policy agent was disabled. |\n| 615 | An IPSec policy agent changed. |\n| 616 | An IPSec policy agent encountered a potentially serious failure.| \n| 617 | A Kerberos policy changed. |\n| 618 | Encrypted Data Recovery policy changed.| \n| 620 | A trust relationship with another domain was modified.| \n| 621 | System access was granted to an account. |\n| 622 | System access was removed from an account.| \n| 623 | Per user auditing policy was set for a user.| \n| 625 | Per user audit policy was refreshed. |\n| 768 | A collision was detected between a namespace element in one forest and a namespace element in another forest.<br>**Note**  When a namespace element in one forest overlaps a namespace element in another forest, it can lead to ambiguity in resolving a name belonging to one of the namespace elements.
