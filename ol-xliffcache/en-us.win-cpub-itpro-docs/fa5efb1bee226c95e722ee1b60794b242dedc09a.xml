Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the **Deny log on locally** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting determines which users are prevented from logging on directly at the device's console.\n\nConstant: SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   User-defined list of accounts\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n1.  Assign the **Deny log on locally** user right to the local guest account to restrict access by potentially unauthorized users.\n2.  Test your modifications to this policy setting in conjunction with the **Allow log on locally** policy setting to determine if the user account is subject to both policies.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\User Rights Assignment\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default policy values for the most recent supported versions of Windows. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy | Not defined | \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Domain Controller Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Not defined| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features, tools, and guidance to help you manage this policy.\n\nA restart of the device is not required for this policy setting to be effective.\n\nAny change to the user rights assignment for an account becomes effective the next time the owner of the account logs on.\n\nIf you apply this policy setting to the Everyone group, no one will be able to log on locally.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nThis policy setting supersedes the **Allow log on locally** policy setting if a user account is subject to both policies.\n\nSettings are applied in the following order through a Group Policy Object (GPO), which will overwrite settings on the local computer at the next Group Policy update:\n\n1.  Local policy settings\n2.  Site policy settings\n3.  Domain policy settings\n4.  OU policy settings\n\nWhen a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nAny account with the ability to log on locally could be used to log on at the console of the device. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who must log on to the console of the device, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software that elevates their user rights.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nAssign the **Deny log on locally** user right to the local Guest account. If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET, you may want to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nIf you assign the **Deny log on locally** user right to additional accounts, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific roles in your environment. However, this user right should explicitly be assigned to the ASPNET account on device that are configured with the Web Server role. You should confirm that delegated activities are not adversely affected.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [User Rights Assignment](user-rights-assignment.md)\n"}
