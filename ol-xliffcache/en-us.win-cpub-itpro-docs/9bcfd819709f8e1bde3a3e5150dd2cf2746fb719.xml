For more information about the various available policies, see [Planning for MBAM 1.0 Group Policy Requirements](planning-for-mbam-10-group-policy-requirements.md). When you have determined the policies that you are going to use, you must use the MBAM 1.0 Group Policy template to create and deploy one or more Group Policy objects (GPO) that include the MBAM policy settings.\n\n## Install the MBAM 1.0 Group Policy template\n\n\nIn addition to providing server-related features of MBAM, the server setup application includes an MBAM Group Policy template.
