Ensure that App-V 4.6 package is published to the users but the FTAs and shortcuts have been assumed by App-V 5.1 package using the following migration method, [How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to App-V 5.1 for a Specific User](how-to-migrate-extension-points-from-an-app-v-46-package-to-app-v-51-for-a-specific-user.md).\n\n    In the **userConfiguration** section of the deployment configuration file for the converted package, to set the policy, make the following update to the **userConfiguration** section: **ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46=\"false\" PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;**\n\n2.  From an elevated command prompt, type:\n\n    PS&gt;**Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg –DynamicUserConfigurationPath** &lt;path to user configuration file&gt;\n\n3.  Perform a publishing refresh, or wait for the next scheduled publishing refresh for the App-V 4.6. Open the application using FTAs or shortcuts. The Application should now open using App-V 4.6.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If you do not need the App-V 5.1 package anymore, you can unpublish the App-V 5.1 package and the extension points will automatically revert to App-V 4.6.\n\n     \n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
