# Illustrated Features of an MBAM 2.5 Deployment


This topic describes the individual features that make up a Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 deployment for the following topologies:

-   MBAM Stand-alone

-   System Center Configuration Manager Integration

**Important**  
These features do not represent the recommended architecture for deploying MBAM. Use this information only as a guide to understand the individual features that make up an MBAM deployment. See [High-Level Architecture for MBAM 2.5](high-level-architecture-for-mbam-25.md) for the recommended architecture for MBAM.

 

For a list of the supported versions of the software mentioned in this topic, see [MBAM 2.5 Supported Configurations](mbam-25-supported-configurations.md).
