powerful management for virtualized applications. For more information see, [App-V 5.0 Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=325265) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=325265).\n\n## Changes in Standard App-V 5.0 SP2 Functionality\n\n\nThe following sections contain information about the changes in standard functionality for App-V 5.0 SP2.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-sp2-supported-cfg\"></a>Support for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1\n\nApp-V 5.0 includes support for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"-------------app-v-5-0-sp2-now-supports-folder-redirection-for-the-user-s-roaming-appdata-directory\"></a> App-V 5.0 SP2 now supports folder redirection for the user’s roaming AppData directory\n\nApp-V 5.0 SP2 supports roaming AppData (%AppData%) folder redirection. For more information, see the [Planning to Use Folder Redirection with App-V](planning-to-use-folder-redirection-with-app-v.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-pkg-upgr-pendg-tasks\"></a>Package upgrade improvements and pending tasks\n\nIn App-V 5.0 SP2, you are no longer prompted to close a running virtual application when a newer version of the package or connection group is published. If a package or connection group is in use when you try to perform a related task, a message displays to indicate that the object is in use, and that the operation will be attempted at a later time.\n\nTasks that have been placed in a pending state will be performed according to the following rules:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Task type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Applicable rule</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>User-based task, e.g., publishing a package to a user</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The pending task will be performed after the user logs off and then logs back on.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Globally based task, e.g., enabling a connection group globally</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The pending task will be performed when the computer is shut down and then restarted.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nWhen a task is placed in a pending state, the App-V client also generates a registry key for the pending task, as follows:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">User-based or globally based task</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Where the registry key is generated</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>User-based tasks</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>KEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\AppV\\Client\\PendingTasks</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Globally based tasks</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\AppV\\Client\\PendingTasks</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### Virtualizing Microsoft Office 2013 and Microsoft Office 2010 using App-V 5.0\n\nUse the following link for more information about App-V 5.0 supported Microsoft Office scenarios.\n\n[Virtualizing Microsoft Office 2013 for Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0](../solutions/virtualizing-microsoft-office-2013-for-application-virtualization--app-v--50-solutions.md)\n\n**Note**  \nThis document focuses on creating a Microsoft Office 2013 App-V 5.0 Package. However, it also provides information about scenarios for Microsoft Office 2010 with App-V 5.0.\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"-------------app-v-5-0-client-management-user-interface-application\"></a> App-V 5.0 Client Management User Interface Application\n\nIn previous versions of App-V 5.0 the Client Management User Interface (UI) was provided with the App-V 5.0 Client installation. With App-V 5.0 SP2 this is no longer the case. Administrators now have the option to deploy the App-V 5.0 Client UI as a Virtual Application (using all supported App-V deployment configurations) or as an installed application.\n\nFor more information see [Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0 Client UI Application](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=386345) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=386345).\n\n### Side-by-Side (SxS) Assembly Automatic Packaging and Deployment\n\nApp-V 5.0 SP2 now automatically detects side-by-side (SxS) assemblies, and deployment on the computer running the App-V 5.0 SP2 client. A SxS assembly primarily consists of VC++ run-time dependencies or MSXML. In previous versions of App-V, virtual applications that had dependencies on VC run-times required these dependencies to be locally on the computer running the App-V 5.0 SP2 client.\n\nThe following functionality is now supported:\n\n-   The App-V 5.0 sequencer automatically captures the SxS assembly in the package regardless of whether the VC run-time has already been installed on the computer running the sequencer.\n\n-   The App-V 5.0 client automatically installs the required SxS assembly to the computer running the client as required at publishing time.\n\n-   The App-V 5.0 sequencer reports the VC run-time dependency using the sequencer reporting mechanism.\n\n-   The App-V 5.0 sequencer now allows you to exclude the VC run-time dependency in the event that the dependency is already available on the computer running the sequencer.\n\n### Publishing Refresh Improvements\n\nApp-V 5.0 supports several features were added to improve the overall experience of refreshing a set of applications for a specific user.\n\nThe following list displays the publishing refresh enhancements:\n\nThe following list contains more information about how to enable the new publishing refresh improvements.\n\n-   **EnablePublishingRefreshUI** - Enables the publishing refresh progress bar for the computer running the App-V 5.0 Client.\n\n-   **HideUI** - Hides the publishing refresh progress bar during a manual sync.\n\n### New Client Configuration Setting\n\nThe following new client configuration setting is available with App-V 5.0 SP2:\n\n**EnableDynamicVirtualization** - Enables supported Shell Extensions, Browser Helper Objects, and Active X controls to be virtualized and run with virtual applications.\n\nFor more information, see [About Client Configuration Settings](about-client-configuration-settings.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"-------------app-v-5-0-shell-extensions\"></a> App-V 5.0 Shell extensions\n\nApp-V 5.0 SP2 now supports shell extensions.\n\nFor more information see the **App-V 5.0 SP2 shell extension support** section of [Creating and Managing App-V 5.0 Virtualized Applications](creating-and-managing-app-v-50-virtualized-applications.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"---------app-v-5-0-documentation-updates\"></a> App-V 5.0 documentation updates\n\n\nApp-V 5.0 SP2 provides updated documentation for the following scenarios:\n\n-   [Migrating from a Previous Version](migrating-from-a-previous-version-app-v-50.md)\n\n-   [About App-V 5.0](about-app-v-50.md)\n\n-   [About App-V 5.0 Reporting](about-app-v-50-reporting.md) (frequently asked questions section)\n\n## How to Get MDOP Technologies\n\n\nApp-V 5.0 is a part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP). MDOP is part of Microsoft Software Assurance. For more information about Microsoft Software Assurance and acquiring MDOP, see [How Do I Get MDOP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=322049) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=322049).\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization).
