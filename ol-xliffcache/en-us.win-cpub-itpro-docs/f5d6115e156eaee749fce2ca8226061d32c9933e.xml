Common reasons for separating these App-V components include the following:\n\n-   Performance\n\n-   Reliability\n\n-   Availability\n\n-   Scalability\n\nSeparating the Management Server and Management Web Service requires additional configuration for the infrastructure to operate correctly. When you separate these two features but do not complete the procedures described in this topic, the Management Console will connect to the Management Web Service but will not be able to properly authenticate with the data store. The Management Console will not load properly, and the administrator will not be able to complete any administrative tasks.\n\nThis behavior occurs because the Management Web Service cannot use the credentials, passed to it from the Management Console, to access the data store. The solution is to configure the Management Web Service server to be “Trusted for delegation.”\n\n## Configuring Active Directory Domain Services\n\n\nIt is also necessary to configure Active Directory Domain Services properly to work in a distributed environment. This section includes the information you need configure Active Directory Domain Services.\n\n### When SQL Service Uses Local System account\n\nTo set up the environment where the SQL Service uses the local system account, change the properties of the machine account of the Management Web Service to be trusted for delegation. For detailed procedures about how to do this, see [How to Configure the Server to be Trusted for Delegation](how-to-configure-the-server-to-be-trusted-for-delegation.md)\n\n### When SQL Service Uses Domain-Based Account\n\nTo set up the environment where SQL Servers use domain-based service accounts, you need to consider whether or not a variety of factors apply, including the following:\n\n-   Clustering of SQL Server\n\n-   Replication\n\n-   Automated tasks\n\n-   Linked servers\n\nFor information about configuring Active Directory Domain Services when the SQL service uses a domain-based account, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151968>.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
