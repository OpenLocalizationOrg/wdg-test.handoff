This is accomplished by editing the appropriate registry keys, using one of the following methods:\n\n-   Using the Registry Editor directly\n\n-   Using a .reg file\n\n-   Using a scripting language such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell\n\nThere is also an ADM template that you can use. For more information about the ADM template, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121835>.\n\n**Caution**  \nUse care when you edit the registry because errors can leave the computer in an unusable state. Be sure to follow your standard business practices that relate to registry edits. Thoroughly test all proposed changes in a test environment before you deploy them to production computers.\n\n \n\n## In This Section\n\n\n**Important**  \nOn a 64-bit computer, the keys and values described in the following sections will be under HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\Microsoft\\\\SoftGrid\\\\4.5\\\\Client.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-reset-the-filesystem-cache\"></a>[How to Reset the FileSystem Cache](how-to-reset-the-filesystem-cache.md)  \nProvides the information that is required to reset the FileSystem cache.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-change-the-size-of-the-filesystem-cache\"></a>[How to Change the Size of the FileSystem Cache](how-to-change-the-size-of-the-filesystem-cache.md)  \nExplains how you can change the size of the cache.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-use-the-cache-space-management-feature\"></a>[How to Use the Cache Space Management Feature](how-to-use-the-cache-space-management-feature.md)  \nDescribes how you can configure the cache space management feature.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-the-client-log-file\"></a>[How to Configure the Client Log File](how-to-configure-the-client-log-file.md)  \nDescribes the various registry key values that control the client log file and how you can change them.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-user-permissions\"></a>[How to Configure User Permissions](how-to-configure-user-permissions.md)  \nIdentifies the registry key that controls the user permissions and gives examples of how you can change some permissions.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-the-client-for-application-package-retrieval\"></a>[How to Configure the Client for Application Package Retrieval](how-to-configure-the-client-for-application-package-retrieval.md)  \nExplains how to configure the client to retrieve package content, icons, and file type associations from different sources, and provides several examples of the correct path format.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-the-client-for-disconnected-operation-mode\"></a>[How to Configure the Client for Disconnected Operation Mode](how-to-configure-the-client-for-disconnected-operation-mode.md)  \nProvides information about how to configure the various settings associated with disconnected operations mode.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-shortcut-and-file-type-association-behavior\"></a>[How to Configure Shortcut and File Type Association Behavior](how-to-configure-shortcut-and-file-type-association-behavior-46-only.md)  \nDescribes the registry key values that control shortcuts and file type associations in the App-V client, and provides details on how to configure them.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Client](application-virtualization-client.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
