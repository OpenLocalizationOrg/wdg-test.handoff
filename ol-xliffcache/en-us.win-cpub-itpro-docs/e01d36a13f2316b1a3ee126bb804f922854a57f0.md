# How to Revert Extension Points From an App-V 5.1 Package to an App-V 4.6 Package for a Specific User


Use the following procedure to revert an App-V 5.1 package to the App-V file format using the user configuration file.

**To revert a package**

1.  Ensure that App-V 4.6 package is published to the users but the FTAs and shortcuts have been assumed by App-V 5.1 package using the following migration method, [How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to App-V 5.1 for a Specific User](how-to-migrate-extension-points-from-an-app-v-46-package-to-app-v-51-for-a-specific-user.md).

    In the **userConfiguration** section of the deployment configuration file for the converted package, to set the policy, make the following update to the **userConfiguration** section: **ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46="false" PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;**

2.  From an elevated command prompt, type:

    PS&gt;**Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg â€“DynamicUserConfigurationPath**&lt;path to user configuration file&gt;

3.  Perform a publishing refresh, or wait for the next scheduled publishing refresh for the App-V 4.6. Open the application using FTAs or shortcuts. The Application should now open using App-V 4.6.

    **Note**  
    If you do not need the App-V 5.1 package anymore, you can unpublish the App-V 5.1 package and the extension points will automatically revert to App-V 4.6.
