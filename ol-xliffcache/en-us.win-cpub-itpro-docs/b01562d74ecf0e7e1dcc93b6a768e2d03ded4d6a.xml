Changes\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Directory Service Changes determines whether the operating system generates audit events when changes are made to objects in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).\n\nAuditing of directory service objects can provide information about the old and new properties of the objects that were changed.\n\nAudit events are generated only for objects with configured system access control lists ([SACLs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)), and only when they are accessed in a manner that matches their [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx) settings. Some objects and properties do not cause audit events to be generated due to settings on the object class in the schema.\n\nThis subcategory only logs events on domain controllers.\n\n**Event volume**: High on domain controllers.\n\nThis subcategory triggers events when an Active Directory object was modified, created, undeleted, moved, or deleted.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | It is important to track actions related to high value or critical Active Directory objects, for example, changes to [AdminSDHolder](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.09.sdadminholder.aspx) container or Domain Admins group objects. <br>This subcategory shows you what actions were performed.
