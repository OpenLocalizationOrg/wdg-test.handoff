## Security Monitoring Recommendations

-   We recommend triggering an alert for any occurrence of this event. The event shows that the system halted because it could not record an auditable event in the Security Log, as described in [CrashOnAuditFail](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc963220.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396).

-   If your computers donâ€™t have the [CrashOnAuditFail](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc963220.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) flag enabled, then this event will be a sign that some settings are not set to baseline settings or were changed.
