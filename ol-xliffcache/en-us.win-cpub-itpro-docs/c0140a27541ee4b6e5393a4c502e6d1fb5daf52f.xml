Server 2016\n\n\nAudit SAM, which enables you to audit events that are generated by attempts to access Security Account Manager ([SAM](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756748(v=ws.10).aspx)) objects.\n\nThe Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database that is present on computers running Windows operating systems that stores user accounts and security descriptors for users on the local computer.\n\n-   SAM objects include the following:\n\n-   SAM\\_ALIAS: A local group\n\n-   SAM\\_GROUP: A group that is not a local group\n\n-   SAM\\_USER: A user account\n\n-   SAM\\_DOMAIN: A domain\n\n-   SAM\\_SERVER: A computer account\n\nIf you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a SAM object is accessed. Success audits record successful attempts, and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\n\nOnly a [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx) for SAM\\_SERVER can be modified.\n\nChanges to user and group objects are tracked by the Account Management audit category. However, user accounts with enough privileges could potentially alter the files in which the account and password information is stored in the system, bypassing any Account Management events.\n\n**Event volume**: High on domain controllers.\n\nFor information about reducing the number of events generated in this subcategory, see [KB841001](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/841001).\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | -               | -               | -                | -                | There is no recommendation for this subcategory in this document, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor at [Security Account Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756748(v=ws.10).aspx) level. |\n| Member Server     | -               | -               | -                | -                | There is no recommendation for this subcategory in this document, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor at [Security Account Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756748(v=ws.10).aspx) level. |\n| Workstation       | -               | -               | -                | -                | There is no recommendation for this subcategory in this document, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor at [Security Account Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756748(v=ws.10).aspx) level. |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4661](event-4661.md)(S, F): A handle to an object was requested.\n\n# \n\n"}
