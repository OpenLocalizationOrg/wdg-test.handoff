Their gesture is only valid on the enrolled device.\n\nAlthough the organization may require users to change their Active Directory or Azure Active Directory (AD) account password at regular intervals, changes to their passwords have no effect on Passport.\n\nPeople who are currently using virtual smart cards for authentication can use their virtual smart card to verify their identity when they set up Passport.\n\n## On devices owned by the organization\n\nWhen someone sets up a new device, they are prompted to choose who owns the device. For corporate devices, they select **This device belongs to my organization**.\n\n![who owns this pc](images/corpown.png)\n\nNext, they select a way to connect. Tell the people in your enterprise which option they should pick here.\n\n![choose how you'll connect](images/connect.png)\n\nThey sign in, and are then asked to verify their identity. People have options to choose from, such as a text message, phone call, or authentication app. After verification, they create their PIN. The **Create a work PIN** screen displays any complexity requirements that you have set, such as minimum length.\n\nAfter Passport is set up, people use their PIN to unlock the device, and that will automatically log them on.\n\n## On personal devices\n\nPeople who want to access work resources on their personal devices can add a work or school account in **Settings** &gt; **Accounts** &gt; **Work or school**, and then sign in with work credentials. The person selects the method for receiving the verification code, such as text message or email. The verification code is sent and the person then enters the verification code. After verification, the person enters and confirms new PIN. The person can access any token-based resource using this device without being asked for credentials. (This work account gesture doesn't affect the device unlock PIN.)\n\nAssure people that their work credentials and personal credentials are stored in separate containers; the enterprise has no access to their personal credentials.\n\nPeople can go to **Settings** &gt; **Accounts** &gt; **Work or school**, select the work account, and then select **Unjoin** to remove the account from their device.\n\n## Using Windows Hello and biometrics\n\nIf your policy allows it, people can add Windows Hello to their Passport. Windows Hello can be fingerprint, iris, and facial recognition, and is available to users only if the hardware supports it.\n\n![sign in to windows, apps, and services using fingerprint or face](images/hellosettings.png)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bmk-remote\"></a>Use a phone to sign in to a PC\n\nIf your enterprise enables phone sign-in, users can pair a phone running Windows 10 Mobile to a PC running Windows 10 and then use an app on the phone to sign in to the PC using their Microsoft Passport credentials.\n> **Note:**  Phone sign-in is currently limited to select Technology Adoption Program (TAP) participants.\n \n**Prerequisites:**\n-   The PC must be joined to the Active Directory domain or Azure AD cloud domain.\n-   The PC must have Bluetooth connectivity.\n-   The phone must be joined to the Azure AD cloud domain, or the user must have added a work account to their personal phone.\n-   The free **Phone Sign-in** app must be installed on the phone.\n**Pair the PC and phone**\n1.

On the phone, go to **Settings** &gt; **Devices** &gt; **Bluetooth**, and verify that the passcode for **Pairing accessory** on the phone matches the passcode displayed on the PC, and then tap **ok**.\n\n    ![bluetooth pairing passcode](images/bt-passcode.png)\n    \n3.  On the PC, tap **Yes**.\n**Sign in to PC using the phone**\n1.  Open the **Phone Sign-in** app and tap the name of the PC to sign in to.\n    > **Note: **  The first time that you run the Phone-Sign app, you must add an account.\n     \n2.
