Restarting the MED-V workspace is basically the same as restarting a physical computer. Resetting the MED-V workspace reruns first time setup and deletes all data that is stored in the virtual machine. Because all stored data is deleted, you typically should only reset the MED-V workspace to resolve the most serious troubleshooting issues, or to restore a previously working MED-V workspace back to a working state.\n\nFor information about how to open the MED-V Administration Toolkit, see [Troubleshooting MED-V by Using the Administration Toolkit](troubleshooting-med-v-by-using-the-administration-toolkit.md).\n\n**Restarting a MED-V Workspace**\n\n1.  On the **MED-V Administration Toolkit** window, click **Restart MED-V Workspace**. A dialog window opens in which you must confirm that you want to restart the MED-V workspace.\n\n2.  Click **Restart**.\n\n    Any published applications that are running or redirected web sites that are open will be closed when the MED-V workspace restarts.\n\n**Resetting a MED-V Workspace**\n\n1.
