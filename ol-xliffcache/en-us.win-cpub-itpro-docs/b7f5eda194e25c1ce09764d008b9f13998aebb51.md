# Cortana integration in your business or enterprise
**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

The world’s first personal digital assistant helps users get things done, even at work. Cortana includes powerful configuration options specifically to optimize for unique small to medium-sized business and enterprise environments.

## Cortana integration with Office 365
Cortana in Windows 10 is already great at letting your employees quickly see what the day is going to look like, see where and when their meetings are going to be, get a sense of travel times to and from work, and even get updates from a calendar for upcoming trips.

But Cortana works even harder when she connects to Office 365, helping employees prepare for meetings, learn about co-workers, and receive reminders about where they need to be so they won’t be late.

**More info:**

-   For specific info about what you need to know as a company administrator, including how to turn off Cortana with Office 365, see the [Cortana integration with Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=717378) support topic.

-   For a quick review of the frequently asked questions about Cortana and Office 365 integration, see the blog post, [An early look at Cortana integration with Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=717379).

## Cortana and Power BI
Integration between Cortana and Power BI shows how Cortana can work with custom business analytics solutions to enable you to get answers directly from your key business data, including introducing new features that let you create custom Cortana answers using the full capabilities of Power BI Desktop.

## Cortana and Microsoft Dynamics CRM
Cortana integration is a Preview feature that's available for your test or dev environment, starting with the CRM Online 2016 Update. If you decide to use this Preview feature, you'll need to turn in on and accept the license terms. After that, salespeople will get proactive insights from Cortana on important CRM activities, including sales leads, accounts, and opportunities; presenting the most relevant info at any given time.

## Cortana and privacy
We understand that there are concerns about Cortana and enterprise privacy, so we’ve put together the [Cortana, Search, and privacy: FAQ](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=717383) topic that covers many of the frequently asked questions. These questions include things such as what info is collected by Cortana, where the info is saved, how to manage what data is collected, how to turn Cortana off, how to opt completely out of data collection, and what info is shared with other Microsoft apps and services.
