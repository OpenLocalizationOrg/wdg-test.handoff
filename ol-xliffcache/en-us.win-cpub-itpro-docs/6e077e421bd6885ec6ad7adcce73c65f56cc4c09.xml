reporting server on a standalone computer and connect it to the database.\n\n**Important**  \nBefore performing the following procedure you should read and understand [About App-V 5.0 Reporting](about-app-v-50-reporting.md).\n\n \n\n**To install the reporting server on a standalone computer and connect it to the database**\n\n1.  Copy the App-V 5.0 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it on. To start the App-V 5.0 server installation right-click and run **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** as an administrator. Click **Install**.\n\n2.  On the **Getting Started** page, review and accept the license terms, and click **Next**.\n\n3.  On the **Use Microsoft Update to help keep your computer secure and up-to-date** page, to enable Microsoft updates, select **Use Microsoft Update when I check for updates (recommended).** To disable Microsoft updates, select **I don’t want to use Microsoft Update**. Click **Next**.\n\n4.  On the **Feature Selection** page, select the **Reporting Server** checkbox and click **Next**.\n\n5.

If you are using a custom Microsoft SQL Server instance, you must select **Use a custom instance** and then type the name of the instance.\n\n    Specify the **SQL Server Database name** that this reporting server will use, for example **AppvReporting**.\n\n7.  On the **Configure Reporting Server Configuration** page.\n\n    -   Specify the Website Name that you want to use for the Reporting Service. Leave the default unchanged if you do not have a custom name.\n\n    -   For the **Port binding**, specify a unique port number that will be used by App-V 5.0, for example **55555**.
