If you do turn off UAC, all Univeral Windows Platform apps stop working. You must always set the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\System\\\\EnableLUA** registry value to 1. If you need to provide auto elevation for programmatic access or installation, you could set the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\System\\\\ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin** registry value to 0, which is the same as setting the UAC slider Never Notify. This is not recommended for devices running Windows 10.\n\nFor more info about how manage UAC, see [UAC Group Policy Settings and Registry Key Settings](../keep-secure/user-account-control-group-policy-and-registry-key-settings.md).\n\nIn Windows 10, User Account Control has added some improvements.\n\n## New features in Windows 10\n\n-   **Integration with the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)**. The [AMSI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn889587.aspx) scans all UAC elevation requests for malware. If malware is detected, the admin privilege is blocked.\n\n[Learn how to manage User Account Control within your organization](../keep-secure/user-account-control-overview.md).\n \n \n"}
