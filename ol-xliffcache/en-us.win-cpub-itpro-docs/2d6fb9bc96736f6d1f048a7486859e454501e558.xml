For details, see the documentation available with the ESD you are using.\n\nFor component requirements and options for using an ESD to deploy App-V packages, see [Planning to Deploy App-V 5.1 with an Electronic Software Distribution System](planning-to-deploy-app-v-51-with-an-electronic-software-distribution-system.md).\n\nUse one of the following methods to publish packages to App-V client computers with an ESD:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Functionality provided by a third-party ESD</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Use the functionality in a third-party ESD.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Stand-alone Windows Installer</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Install the application on the target client computer by using the associated Windows Installer (.msi) file that is created when you initially sequence an application.

Install the App-V 5.1 Sequencer on a computer in your environment. For more information about installing the sequencer, see [How to Install the Sequencer](how-to-install-the-sequencer-51beta-gb18030.md).\n\n2.  Use the App-V 5.1 Sequencer to create virtual application. For information about creating a virtual application, see [Creating and Managing App-V 5.1 Virtualized Applications](creating-and-managing-app-v-51-virtualized-applications.md).\n\n3.  After you create the virtual application, deploy the package by using your ESD solution.\n\n    If you are using System Center Configuration Manager, start by reviewing [Introduction to Application Management in Configuration Manager](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=281816) for information about using App-V 5.1 and System Center 2012 Configuration Manager.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
