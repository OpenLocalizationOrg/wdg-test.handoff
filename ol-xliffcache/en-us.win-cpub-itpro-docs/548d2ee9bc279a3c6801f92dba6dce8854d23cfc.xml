Ensure that App-V 4.6 package is published to the users but the FTAs and shortcuts have been assumed by App-V 5.1 package using the following migration method, [How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to a Converted App-V 5.1 Package for All Users on a Specific Computer](how-to-migrate-extension-points-from-an-app-v-46-package-to-a-converted-app-v-51-package-for-all-users-on-a-specific-computer.md).\n\n    In the **userConfiguration** section of the deployment configuration file for the converted package, to set the policy, make the following update to the **userConfiguration** section: **ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46=\"false\" PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;**\n\n2.  From an elevated command prompt, type:\n\n    PS&gt;**Set-AppvClientPackage $pkg –DynamicDeploymentConfiguration** &lt;path to deployment configuration file&gt;\n\n    PS&gt;**Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg –DynamicUserConfigurationType useDeploymentConfiguration**\n\n3.  Perform a publishing refresh, or wait for the next scheduled publishing refresh for the App-V 4.6 package.\n\n    Open the application using FTAs or shortcuts.
