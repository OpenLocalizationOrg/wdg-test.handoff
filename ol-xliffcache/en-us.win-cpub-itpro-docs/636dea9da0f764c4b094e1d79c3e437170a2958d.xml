See [Planning for MBAM 2.0 Group Policy Requirements](planning-for-mbam-20-group-policy-requirements-mbam-2.md) for more information on the different policies that are available. When you have determined the policies that you are going to use, you then must create and deploy one or more Group Policy Objects (GPO) that include the policy settings for MBAM by using the MBAM 2.0 Group Policy template.\n\n## Install the MBAM 2.0 Group Policy Template\n\n\nIn addition to the server-related Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring features, the server setup application includes a MBAM Group Policy template.
