Computer account name ends with **$** character.\n\n    -   User account example: dadmin\n\n    -   Computer account example: WIN81$\n\n-   **Supplied Realm Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the Kerberos Realm that **Account Name** belongs to. This can appear in a variety of formats, including the following:\n\n    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO\n\n    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local\n\n    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **Kerberos Realm** is a set of managed nodes that share the same Kerberos database. The Kerberos database resides on the Kerberos master computer system, which should be kept in a physically secure room. Active Directory domain is the example of Kerberos Realm in the Microsoft Windows Active Directory world.\n\n-   **User ID** \\[Type = SID\\]**:** SID of account for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n    For example: CONTOSO\\\\dadmin or CONTOSO\\\\WIN81$.\n\n    -   **NULL SID** – this value shows in [4768](event-4768.md) Failure events.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n**Service Information:**\n\n-   **Service Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the name of the service in the Kerberos Realm to which TGT request was sent. Typically has value “**krbtgt”** for TGT requests, which means Ticket Granting Ticket issuing service.\n\n    -   For Failure events **Service Name** typically has the following format: **krbtgt/REALM\\_NAME**. For example: krbtgt/CONTOSO.\n\n-   **Service ID** \\[Type = SID\\]**:** SID of the service account in the Kerberos Realm to which TGT request was sent. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n    Domain controllers have a specific service account (**krbtgt**) that is used by the [Key Distribution Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378170(v=vs.85).aspx) (KDC) service to issue Kerberos tickets. It has a built-in, pre-defined SID: S-1-5-21-[DOMAIN\\_IDENTIFIER](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962011.aspx)-502.\n\n    -   **NULL SID** – this value shows in [4768](event-4768.md) Failure events.\n\n**Network Information:**\n\n-   **Client Address** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** IP address of the computer from which the TGT request was received.

For example, you might need to monitor for use of an account outside of working hours.                                                                                | When you monitor for anomalies or malicious actions, use the **“User ID”** (with other information) to monitor how or when a particular account is being used. |\n| **Non-active accounts**: You might have non-active, disabled, or guest accounts, or other accounts that should never be used.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Monitor this event with the **“User ID”** that corresponds to the accounts that should never be used.                                                          |\n| **Account whitelist**: You might have a specific whitelist of accounts that are the only ones allowed to perform actions corresponding to particular events.                                                                                                                                                      | If this event corresponds to a “whitelist-only” action, review the **“User ID”** for accounts that are outside the whitelist.                                  |\n| **External accounts**: You might be monitoring accounts from another domain, or “external” accounts that are not allowed to perform certain actions (represented by certain specific events).                                                                                                                     | Monitor this event for the **“Supplied Realm Name”** corresponding to another domain or “external” location.                                                   |\n| **Account naming conventions**: Your organization might have specific naming conventions for account names.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Monitor “**User ID”** for names that don’t comply with naming conventions.                                                                                     |\n\n-   You can track all [4768](event-4768.md) events where the **Client Address** is not from your internal IP range or not from private IP ranges.\n\n-   If you know that **Account Name** should be used only from known list of IP addresses, track all **Client Address** values for this **Account Name** in [4768](event-4768.md) events. If **Client Address** is not from the whitelist, generate the alert.\n\n-   All **Client Address** = ::1 means local authentication. If you know the list of accounts which should log on to the domain controllers, then you need to monitor for all possible violations, where **Client Address** = ::1 and **Account Name** is not allowed to log on to any domain controller.\n\n-   All [4768](event-4768.md) events with **Client Port** field value &gt; 0 and &lt; 1024 should be examined, because a well-known port was used for outbound connection.\n\n-   Also consider monitoring the fields shown in the following table, to discover the issues listed:\n\n| **Field**                   | **Issue to discover**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Certificate Issuer Name** | Certification authority name is not from your PKI infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **Certificate Issuer Name** | Certification authority name is not authorized to issue smart card authentication certificates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **0**, which means that pre-authentication was not used. All accounts should use Pre-Authentication, except accounts configured with “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication,” which is a security risk. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                         |\n| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 15** when account must use a smart card for authentication.

DES should not be in use, because of low security and known vulnerabilities. It is disabled by default starting from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see [Table 4. Kerberos encryption types](#kerberos-encryption-types).                             |\n| **Ticket Encryption Type**  | Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, monitor for values **other than 0x11 and 0x12**. These are the expected values, starting with these operating systems, and represent AES-family algorithms. For more information, see [Table 4. Kerberos encryption types](#kerberos-encryption-types).                                            |\n| **Result Code**             | **0x6** (The username doesn't exist), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This can be an indicator of account enumeration attack, especially for highly critical accounts.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **Result Code**             | **0x7** (Server not found in Kerberos database). This error can occur if the domain controller cannot find the server's name in Active Directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **Result Code**             | **0x8** (Multiple principal entries in KDC database).

This error can help you to identify problems with Kerberos authentication faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| **Result Code**             | **0xA** (Ticket (TGT) not eligible for postdating). Microsoft systems should not request postdated tickets. These events could help identify anomaly activity.                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Result Code**             | **0xC** (Requested start time is later than end time), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This can be an indicator of an account compromise attempt, especially for highly critical accounts.                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Result Code**             | **0xE** (KDC has no support for encryption type). In general, this error occurs when the KDC or a client receives a packet that it cannot decrypt. Monitor for these events because this should not happen in a standard Active Directory environment.                                                                                                  |\n| **Result Code**             | **0xF** (KDC has no support for checksum type).
