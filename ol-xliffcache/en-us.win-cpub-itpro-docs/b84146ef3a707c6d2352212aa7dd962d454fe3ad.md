# Protect derived domain credentials with Credential Guard

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

Introduced in Windows 10 Enterprise, Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes and Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets.

Credential Guard offers the following features and solutions:

-   
            **Hardware security** Credential Guard increases the security of derived domain credentials by taking advantage of platform security features including, Secure Boot and virtualization.
-   
            **Virtualization-based security** Windows services that manage derived domain credentials and other secrets run in a protected environment that is isolated from the running operating system.
-   
            **Better protection against advanced persistent threats** Securing derived domain credentials using the virtualization-based security blocks the credential theft attack techniques and tools used in many targeted attacks. Malware running in the operating system with administrative privileges cannot extract secrets that are protected by virtualization-based security. While Credential Guard is a powerful mitigation, persistent threat attacks will likely shift to new attack techniques and you should also incorporate Device Guard and other security strategies and architectures.
-   
            **Manageability** You can manage Credential Guard by using Group Policy, WMI, from a command prompt, and Windows PowerShell.

## How it works

Credential Guard isolates secrets that previous versions of Windows stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA) by using virtualization-based security. Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Credential Guard, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system. LSA uses remote procedure calls to communicate with the isolated LSA process.

For security reasons, the isolated LSA process doesn't host any device drivers. Instead, it only hosts a small subset of operating system binaries that are needed for security and nothing else. All of these binaries are signed with a certificate that is trusted by virtualization-based security and these signatures are validated before launching the file in the protected environment.

Credential Guard also does not allow older variants of NTLM, unconstrained Kerberos delegation, and Kerberos authentication protocols and cipher suites when using default derived credentials, including NTLMv1, MS-CHAPv2, and weaker Kerberos encryption types, such as DES.
Here's a high-level overview on how the LSA is isolated by using virtualization-based security:

ยน If you choose the **Secure Boot and DMA protection** option in the Group Policy setting, an IOMMU is required. The **Secure Boot** Group Policy option enables Credential Guard on devices without an IOMMU.

## Manage Credential Guard

Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security features that must be enabled on each PC before you can use it.

### Turn on Credential Guard by using Group Policy

You can use Group Policy to enable Credential Guard because it will add the virtualization-based security features for you.
1.  From the Group Policy Management Console, go to **Computer Configuration** -&gt;**Administrative Templates** -&gt;**System** -&gt;**Device Guard**.
2.  Double-click **Turn On Virtualization Based Security**, and then click the **Enabled** option.
3.  
            **Select Platform Security Level** box, choose **Secure Boot** or **Secure Boot and DMA Protection**.
4.  In the **Credential Guard Configuration** box, click **Enabled with UEFI lock**, and then click **OK**. If you want to be able to turn off Credential Guard remotely, choose **Enabled without lock**.

    ![Credential Guard Group Policy setting](images/credguard-gp.png)
    
5.  Close the Group Policy Management Console.

### Add Credential Guard to an image

If you would like to add Credential Guard to an image, you can do this by adding the virtualization-based security features and then turning on Credential Guard.

### Add the virtualization-based security features

First, you must add the virtualization-based security features. You can do this by using either the Control Panel or the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM).
> 
            **Note:**  If you enable Credential Guard by using Group Policy, these steps are not required. Group Policy will install the features for you.
 
**Add the virtualization-based security features by using Programs and Features**
1.  Open the Programs and Features control panel.
2.  Click **Turn Windows feature on or off**.
3.  Select the **Isolated User Mode** check box.
4.  Go to **Hyper-V** -&gt;**Hyper-V Platform**, and then select the **Hyper-V Hypervisor** check box.
5.  Click **OK**.

**Add the virtualization-based security features to an offline image by using DISM**
1.  Open an elevated command prompt.
2.  Add the Hyper-V Hypervisor by running the following command:
    ``` syntax
    dism /image:<WIM file name> /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor /all
    ```
3.  Add Isolated User Mode by running the following command:
    ``` syntax
    dism /image:<WIM file name> /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:IsolatedUserMode
    ```
> 
            **Note:**  You can also add these features to an online image by using either DISM or Configuration Manager.
 
### Turn on Credential Guard

If you don't use Group Policy, you can enable Credential Guard by using the registry.

**Turn on Credential Guard by using the registry**

1.  Open Registry Editor.
2.  Enable virtualization-based security:
    -   Go to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\DeviceGuard.
    -   Add a new DWORD value named **EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity**. Set the value of this registry setting to 1 to enable virtualization-based security and set it to 0 to disable it.
    -   Add a new DWORD value named **RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures**. Set the value of this registry setting to 1 to use **Secure Boot** only or set it to 3 to use **Secure Boot and DMA protection**.
3.  Enable Credential Guard:
    -   Go to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA.
    -   Add a new DWORD value named **LsaCfgFlags**. Set the value of this registry setting to 1 to enable Credential Guard with UEFI lock, set it to 2 to enable Credential Guard without lock, and set it to 0 to disable it.
4.  Close Registry Editor.

> 
            **Note:**  You can also turn on Credential Guard by setting the registry entries in the [FirstLogonCommands](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn922797.aspx) unattend setting.
 
### Remove Credential Guard

If you have to remove Credential Guard on a PC, you need to do the following:

1.  If you used Group Policy, disable the Group Policy setting that you used to enable Credential Guard (**Computer Configuration** -&gt;**Administrative Templates** -&gt;**System** -&gt;**Device Guard** -&gt;**Turn on Virtualization Based Security**).
2.  Delete the following registry setting: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\\LsaCfgFlags
3.  Delete the Credential Guard EFI variables by using bcdedit.

**Delete the Credential Guard EFI variables**

1.  From an elevated command prompt, type the following commands:
    ``` syntax
    mountvol X: /s
    copy %WINDIR%\System32\SecConfig.efi X:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\SecConfig.efi /Y
    bcdedit /create {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} /d "DebugTool" /application osloader
    bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} path "\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\SecConfig.efi"
    bcdedit /set {bootmgr} bootsequence {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215}
    bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} loadoptions DISABLE-LSA-ISO
    bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} device partition=X:
    mountvol X: /d
    ```
2.  Restart the PC.
3.  Accept the prompt to disable Credential Guard.
4.  Alternatively, you can disable the virtualization-based security features to turn off Credential Guard.

> 
            **Note: ** The PC must have one-time access to a domain controller to decrypt content, such as files that were encrypted with EFS. If you want to turn off both Credential Guard and virtualization-based security, run the following bcdedit command after turning off all virtualization-based security Group Policy and registry settings: bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} loadoptions DISABLE-LSA-ISO,DISABLE-VBS

For more info on virtualization-based security and Device Guard, see [Device Guard deployment guide](device-guard-deployment-guide.md).
 
### Check that Credential Guard is running

You can use System Information to ensure that Credential Guard is running on a PC.

1.  Click **Start**, type **msinfo32.exe**, and then click **System Information**.
2.  Click **System Summary**.
3.  Confirm that **Credential Guard** is shown next to **Device Guard Security Services Running**.

    Here's an example:
    
    ![System Information](images/credguard-msinfo32.png)
    
## Considerations when using Credential Guard

-   If Credential Guard is enabled on a device after it's joined to a domain, the user and device secrets may already be compromised. We recommend that Credential Guard is enabled before the PC is joined to a domain.
-   You should perform regular reviews of the PCs that have Credential Guard enabled. This can be done with security audit policies or WMI queries. Here's a list of WinInit event IDs to look for:
    -   
            **Event ID 13** Credential Guard (LsaIso.exe) was started and will protect LSA credentials.
    -   
            **Event ID 14** Credential Guard (LsaIso.exe) configuration: 0x1, 0
        -   The first variable: 0x1 means Credential Guard is configured to run. 0x0 means itโs not configured to run.
        -   The second variable: 0 means itโs configured to run in protect mode. 1 means it's configured to run in test mode. This variable should always be 0.
    -   
            **Event ID 15** Credential Guard (LsaIso.exe) is configured but the secure kernel is not running; continuing without Credential Guard.
    -   
            **Event ID 16** Credential Guard (LsaIso.exe) failed to launch: \[error code\]
    -   
                **Event ID 17** Error reading Credential Guard (LsaIso.exe) UEFI configuration: \[error code\]
You can also verify that TPM is being used for key protection by checking the following event in the **Microsoft** -&gt;**Windows** -&gt;**Kernel-Boot** event source. If you are running with a TPM, the TPM PCR mask value will be something other than 0.
    -   
            **Event ID 51** VSM Master Encryption Key Provisioning. Using cached copy status: 0x0. Unsealing cached copy status: 0x1. New key generation status: 0x1. Sealing status: 0x1. TPM PCR mask: 0x0.
-   Passwords are still weak so we recommend that your organization deploy Credential Guard and move away from passwords and to other authentication methods, such as physical smart cards, virtual smart cards, Microsoft Passport, or Microsoft Passport for Work.
-   Some 3rd party Security Support Providers (SSPs and APs) might not be compatible with Credential Guard. Credential Guard does not allow 3rd party SSPs to ask for password hashes from LSA. However, SSPs and APs still get notified of the password when a user logs on and/or changes their password. Any use of undocumented APIs within custom SSPs and APs are not supported. We recommend that custom implementations of SSPs/APs are tested against Credential Guard to ensure that the SSPs and APs do not depend on any undocumented or unsupported behaviors. For example, using the KerbQuerySupplementalCredentialsMessage API is not supported. You should not replace the NTLM or Kerberos SSPs with custom SSPs and APs. For more info, see [Restrictions around Registering and Installing a Security Package](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn865014.aspx) on MSDN.
-   As the depth and breadth of protections provided by Credential Guard are increased, subsequent releases of Windows 10 with Credential Guard running may impact scenarios that were working in the past. For example, Credential Guard may block the use of a particular type of credential or a particular component to prevent malwar efrom taking advantage of vulnerabilities. Therefore, we recommend that scenarios required for operations in an organization are tested before upgrading a device that has Credential Guard running.
-   If you are using Wi-Fi and VPN end points that are based on MS-CHAPv2, they are subject to similar attacks as NTLMv1. We recommend that organizations use certificated-based authentication for Wi-Fi and VPN connections.
-   Starting with Windows 10, version 1511, domain credentials that are stored with Credential Manager are protected with Credential Guard. Credential Manager allows you to store credentials, such as user names and passwords that you use to log on to websites or other computers on a network. The following considerations apply to the Credential Guard protections for Credential Manager:
    -   Credentials saved by Remote Desktop Services cannot be used to remotely connect to another machine without supplying the password. Attempts to use saved credentials will fail, displaying the error message "Logon attempt failed".
    -   Applications that extract derived domain credentials from Credential Manager will no longer be able to use those credentials.
    -   You cannot restore credentials using the Credential Manager control panel if the credentials were backed up from a PC that has Credential Guard turned on. If you need to back up your credentials, you must do this before you enable Credential Guard. Otherwise, you won't be able to restore those credentials.

### Kerberos Considerations

When you enable Credential Guard, you can no longer use Kerberos unconstrained delegation. Unconstrained delegation could allow attackers to extract Kerberos keys from the isolated LSA process. You must use constrained or resource-based Kerberos delegation instead.
    
## Scenarios not protected by Credential Guard

Some ways to store credentials are not protected by Credential Guard, including:

-   Software that manages credentials outside of Windows feature protection
-   Local accounts and Microsoft Accounts
-   Credential Guard does not protect the Active Directory database running on Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview domain controllers. It also does not protect credential input pipelines, such as Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview servers running Remote Desktop Gateway. If you're using a Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview server as a client PC, it will get the same protection as it would be running Windows 10 Enterprise.
-   Key loggers
-   Physical attacks
-   Does not prevent an attacker with malware on the PC from using the privileges associated with any credential. We recommend using dedicated PCs for high value accounts, such as IT Pros and users with access high value assets in your organization.
-   Third-party security packages
-   Digest and CredSSP credentials
    -   When Credential Guard is enabled, neither Digest nor CredSSP have access to users' logon credentials. This implies no Single Sign-On use for these protocols.
-   Supplied credentials for NTLM authentication are not protected. If a user is prompted for and enters credentials for NTLM authentication, these credentials are vulnerable to be read from LSASS memory. Note that these same credentials are vulnerable to key loggers as well.

## Additional mitigations

Credential Guard can provide mitigations against attacks on derived credentials and prevent the use of stolen credentials elsewhere. However, PCs can still be vulnerable to certain attacks, even if the derived credentials are protected by Credential Guard. These attacks can include abusing privileges and use of derived credentials directly from a compromised device, reusing previously stolen credentials prior to Device Guard, and abuse of management tools and weak application configurations. Because of this, additional mitigations also need to be deployed to make the domain environment more robust.

Credential theft attacks allow the attacker to steal secrets from one device and use them from another device. By deploying authentication policies with compound authentication in Windows Server 2012 R2 or later domains, users can be restricted to only sign on from specific domain-joined devices. However, since devices also use shared secrets for authentication, attackers can steal those secrets as well. By deploying device certificates with Credential Guard, authentication policies can require that the device authenticates with its private key. This prevents shared secrets on stolen devices to be used with stolen user passwords or Kerberos secret keys to sign on as the user.

Device certificate authentication has the following requirements:

-   Device domains are Windows Server 2012 or higher and all domain controllers have certificates, which satisfy strict KDC validation (KDC EKU present and the DNS domain name matches the DNSName field of the SubjectAltName (SAN) extension).
-   Windows 10 devices have the CA issuing the domain controller certificates in the enterprise store.
-   A process is established to ensure the identity and trustworthiness of the device in a similar manner as you would establish the identity and trustworthiness of a user before issuing them a smartcard.

### Additional Group Policy settings

There are a few Group Policy settings that you can enable that provide more protection against credential attacks:

-   On the domain controllers, configure the KDC support for claims, compound authentication, and Kerberos armoring system by using Group Policy. Set the **KDC support for claims, compound authentication, and Kerberos armoring** Group Policy setting to either **Supported** or **Always provide claims**.
-   On devices running Windows 10, you can turn it on by using Group Policy as well. To do this, enable the **Kerberos client support for claims, compound authentication and Kerberos armoring** & **Always send compound authentication first system** Group Policy settings under **Computer Configuration** -&gt;**Administrative Templates** -&gt;**System** -&gt;**Kerberos**.

### Compound authentication

Compound authentication adds the device identity to the userโs during authentication to the domain and resources. Without compound authentication, only the userโs secrets are validated. With compound authentication, the Kerberos client has to have both the userโs and deviceโs secrets.
Enabling compound authentication also enables Kerberos armoring, which provides two additional benefits:

-   User authentication on domain-joined devices will be armored. This means that network captures will contain encrypted Kerberos initial authentication. Without the appropriate device key, Kerberos AS-REQs are protected against offline dictionary attacks.
-   KDC errors are signed, which provides protection against error spoofing attacks.

### Deploying machine certificates

If the domain controllers in your organization are running Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, devices running Windows 10 will automatically enroll a machine certificate when Credential Guard is enabled and the PC is joined to the domain.
If the domain controllers are running Windows Server 2012 R2, the machine certificates must be provisioned manually on each device. You can do this by creating a certificate template on the domain controller or certificate authority and deploying the machine certificates to each device.
The same security procedures used for issuing smart cards to users should be applied to machine certificates.

1.  From the Certificate Manager console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, and then click **Manage.**
2.  Right-click **Workstation Authentication**, and then click **Duplicate Template**.
3.  Right-click the new template, and then click **Properties**.
4.  On the **Extensions** tab, click **Application Policies**, and then click **Edit**.
5.  Click **Client Authentication**, and then click **Remove**.
6.  Add the ID-PKInit-KPClientAuth EKU. Click **Add**, click **New**, and then specify the following values:
    -   Name: Kerberos Client Auth
    -   Object Identifier: 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4
7.  On the **Extensions** tab, click **Issuance Policies**, and then click **Edit**.
8.  Under **Issuance Policies**, click**High Assurance**.
9.  On the **Subject name** tab, clear the **DNS name** check box, and then select the **User Principal Name (UPN)** check box.

On devices that are running Credential Guard, enroll the devices using the machine authentication certificate by running the following command:
``` syntax
CertReq -EnrollCredGuardCert MachineAuthentication
```
> 
            **Note:**  You must restart the device after enrolling the machine authentication certificate.
 
### Link the issuance policies to a group

By using an authentication policy, you can ensure that users only sign into devices that are running Credential Guard. Before you deploy the authentication policy though, you must first run a couple of scripts that set up your environment.
-   The [get-IssuancePolicy.ps1](#bkmk-getscript) shows all of the issuance policies that are available on the certificate authority.
    From a Windows PowerShell command prompt, run the following command:
    ``` syntax
    .\get-IssuancePolicy.ps1 โLinkedToGroup:All
    ```
-   The [set-IssuancePolicyToGroupLink.ps1](#bkmk-setscript) creates a Universal security group, creates an organizational unit, and links the issuance policy to that Universal security group.
    From a Windows PowerShell command prompt, run the following command:
    ``` syntax
    .\set-IssuancePolicyToGroupLink.ps1 โIssuancePolicyName:โ<name of issuance policy>โ โgroupOU:โ<Name of OU to create>โ โgroupName:โ<name of Universal security group to create>โ
    ```
### Deploy the authentication policy

Before setting up the authentication policy, you should log any failed attempt to apply an authentication policy on the KDC. To do this in Event Viewer, navigate to **Applications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Authentication, right-click AuthenticationPolicyFailures-DomainController**, and then click **Enable Log**.

Now you can set up an authentication policy to use Credential Guard.

**To add an authentication policy for Credential Guard**

1.  Ensure that your domain controllers are running at least the Windows Server 2012 R2 domain functional level.
2.  Create a security group that will be used to identify the PCs that will have this authentication policy applied to them.
3.  Add the computer account to this security group.
4.  Open Active Directory Administrative Center.
5.  Click **Authentication**, click **New**, and then click **Authentication Policy**.
6.  In the **Display name** box, enter a name for this authentication policy.
7.  Under the **Accounts** heading, click **Add**.
8.  In the **Select Users, Computers, or Service Accounts** dialog box, type the name of the user account, and then click **OK**.
9.  Under the **User** heading, click the **Edit** button that applies to user account.
10. Click **Add a condition**.
11. In the **Edit Access Control Conditions** box, ensure that it reads **User**&gt;**Group**&gt;**Member of each**&gt;**Value**, and then click **Add items**.
12. In the **Select Users, Computers, or Service Accounts** dialog box, type the name of the security group that you created with the set-IssuancePolicyToGroupLink script, and then click **OK**.
13. Click **OK** to close the **Edit Access Control Conditions** box.
14. Click **OK** to create the authentication policy.
15. Close Active Directory Administrative Center.

> 
            **Note:**  When authentication policies in enforcement mode are deployed with Credential Guard, users will not be able to sign in using devices that do not have the machine authentication certificate provisioned. This applies to both local and remote sign in scenarios.

help1 = This command can be used to set the link between a certificate issuance policy and a universal security group.
help2 = Usage:
help3 = The following parameters are required:
help4 = -IssuancePolicyName:<name or display name of the issuance policy that you want to link to a group>
help5 = -groupName:<name of the group you want to link the issuance policy to>. If no name is specified, any existing link to a group is removed from the Issuance Policy.
help6 = The following parameter is optional:
help7 = -groupOU:<Name of the Organizational Unit dedicated to the groups which are linked to issuance policies>. If this parameter is not specified, the group is looked for or created in the Users container.
help8 = Examples:
help9 = This command will link the issuance policy whose display name is "High Assurance" to the group "HighAssuranceGroup" in the Organizational Unit "OU_FOR_IPol_linked_groups". If the group or the Organizational Unit do not exist, you will be prompted to create them.
help10 = This command will unlink the issuance policy whose name is "402.164959C40F4A5C12C6302E31D5476062" from any group.
MultipleIPs = Error: Multiple Issuance Policies with name or display name "{0}" were found in the subtree of "{1}"
NoIP = Error: no issuance policy with name or display name "{0}" could be found in the subtree of "{1}".
IPFound = An Issuance Policy with name or display name "{0}" was successfully found: {1}
MultipleOUs = Error: more than 1 Organizational Unit with name "{0}" could be found in the subtree of "{1}".
confirmOUcreation = Warning: The Organizational Unit that you specified does not exist. Do you want to create it?
OUCreationSuccess = Organizational Unit "{0}" successfully created.
OUcreationError = Error: Organizational Unit "{0}" could not be created.
OUFoundSuccess = Organizational Unit "{0}" was successfully found.
multipleGroups = Error: More than one group with name "{0}" was found in Organizational Unit "{1}".  
confirmGroupCreation = Warning: The group that you specified does not exist. Do you want to create it?
groupCreationSuccess = Univeral Security group "{0}" successfully created.
groupCreationError = Error: Univeral Security group "{0}" could not be created.
GroupFound = Group "{0}" was successfully found.
confirmLinkDeletion = Warning: The Issuance Policy "{0}" is currently linked to group "{1}". Do you really want to remove the link?
UnlinkSuccess = Certificate issuance policy successfully unlinked from any group.
UnlinkError = Removing the link failed.
UnlinkExit = Exiting without removing the link from the issuance policy to the group.
IPNotLinked = The Certificate issuance policy is not currently linked to any group. If you want to link it to a group, you should specify the -groupName option when starting this script.
ErrorNotSecurity = Error: You cannot link issuance Policy "{0}" to group "{1}" because this group is not of type "Security".
ErrorNotUniversal = Error: You cannot link issuance Policy "{0}" to group "{1}" because the scope of this group is not "Universal".
ErrorHasMembers = Error: You cannot link issuance Policy "{0}" to group "{1}" because it has a non-empty membership. The group has the following members:
ConfirmLinkReplacement = Warning: The Issuance Policy "{0}" is currently linked to group "{1}". Do you really want to update the link to point to group "{2}"?
LinkSuccess = The certificate issuance policy was successfully linked to the specified group.
LinkError = The certificate issuance policy could not be linked to the specified group.
ExitNoLinkReplacement = Exiting without setting the new link.
