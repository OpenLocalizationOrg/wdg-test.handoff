This list can be used to troubleshoot XML issues or can be retained as a record of the files that were gathered into the migration store. The List Files log is only available for ScanState.exe.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-diagnosticlog\"></a>Diagnostic Log\n\n\nYou can obtain the diagnostic log by setting the environment variable MIG\\_ENABLE\\_DIAG to a path to an XML file.\n\nThe diagnostic log contains:\n\n-   Detailed system environment information\n\n-   Detailed user environment information\n\n-   Information about the migration units (migunits) being gathered and their contents\n\n## Using the Diagnostic Log\n\n\nThe diagnostic log is essentially a report of all the migration units (migunits) included in the migration. A migunit is a collection of data that is identified by the component it is associated with in the XML files. The migration store is made up of all the migunits in the migration. The diagnostic log can be used to verify which migunits were included in the migration and can be used for troubleshooting while authoring migration XML files.\n\nThe following examples describe common scenarios in which you can use the diagnostic log.\n\n**Why is this file not migrating when I authored an \"include\" rule for it?**\n\nLet’s imagine that we have the following directory structure and that we want the “data” directory to be included in the migration along with the “New Text Document.txt” file in the “New Folder.” The directory of **C:\\\\data** contains:\n\n``` syntax\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          .\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          ..\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          New Folder\n01/21/2009  09:19 PM                13 test (1).txt\n01/21/2009  09:19 PM                13 test.txt\n               2 File(s)             26 bytes\n```\n\nThe directory of **C:\\\\data\\\\New Folder** contains:\n\n``` syntax\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          .\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          ..\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM                 0 New Text Document.txt\n               1 File(s)              0 bytes\n```\n\nTo migrate these files you author the following migration XML:\n\n``` syntax\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<migration urlid=\"http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/TestSuite_BUGFIX\">\n\n<component context=\"System\"  type=\"Application\">\n  <displayName>DATA1</displayName>\n  <role role=\"Data\">\n    <rules>\n      <include>\n        <objectSet>\n          <pattern type=\"File\">c:\\data\\ [*]</pattern>\n        </objectSet>\n      </include>\n\n    </rules>\n  </role>\n</component>\n</migration>\n```\n\nHowever, upon testing the migration you notice that the “New Text Document.txt” file isn’t included in the migration. To troubleshoot this failure, the migration can be repeated with the environment variable MIG\\_ENABLE\\_DIAG set such that the diagnostic log is generated. Upon searching the diagnostic log for the component “DATA1”, the following XML section is discovered:\n\n``` syntax\n<MigUnitList>\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\" Context=\"System\" ConfidenceLevel=\"100\" Group=\"Applications\" Role=\"UserData\" Agent=\"CMXEAgent\" Selected=\"true\" Supported=\"true\">\n<Patterns Type=\"Include\">\n<Pattern Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [*]\"/>\n</Patterns>\n</MigUnit>\n</MigUnitList>\n<Perform Name=\"Gather\" User=\"System\">\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\">\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test (1).txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test.txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n</MigUnit>\n</Perform>\n```\n\nAnalysis of this XML section reveals the migunit that was created when the migration rule was processed. The &lt;Perform&gt; section details the actual files that were scheduled for gathering and the result of the gathering operation. The “New Text Document.txt” file doesn’t appear in this section, which confirms that the migration rule was not correctly authored.\n\nAn analysis of the XML elements reference topic reveals that the &lt;pattern&gt; tag needs to be modified as follows:\n\n``` syntax\n<pattern type=\"File\">c:\\data\\* [*]</pattern>\n```\n\nWhen the migration is preformed again with the modified tag, the diagnostic log reveals the following:\n\n``` syntax\n<MigUnitList>\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\" Context=\"System\" ConfidenceLevel=\"100\" Group=\"Applications\" Role=\"UserData\" Agent=\"CMXEAgent\" Selected=\"true\" Supported=\"true\">\n<Patterns Type=\"Include\">\n<Pattern Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\* [*]\"/>\n</Patterns>\n</MigUnit>\n</MigUnitList>\n<Perform Name=\"Gather\" User=\"System\">\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\">\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test (1).txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test.txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder [New Text Document.txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n</MigUnit>\n</Perform>\n```\n\nThis diagnostic log confirms that the modified &lt;pattern&gt; value enables the migration of the file.\n\n**Why is this file migrating when I authored an exclude rule excluding it?**\n\nIn this scenario, you have the following directory structure and you want all files in the “data” directory to migrate, except for text files. The **C:\\\\Data** folder contains:\n\n``` syntax\nDirectory of C:\\Data\n\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          .\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          ..\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          New Folder\n01/21/2009  09:19 PM                13 test (1).txt\n01/21/2009  09:19 PM                13 test.txt\n               2 File(s)             26 bytes\n```\n\nThe **C:\\\\Data\\\\New Folder\\\\** contains:\n\n``` syntax\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          .\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM    <DIR>          ..\n01/21/2009  10:08 PM                 0 New Text Document.txt\n               1 File(s)              0 bytes\n```\n\nYou author the following migration XML:\n\n``` syntax\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<migration urlid=\"http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/TestSuite_BUGFIX\">\n\n<component context=\"System\"  type=\"Application\">\n  <displayName>DATA1</displayName>\n  <role role=\"Data\">\n    <rules>\n      <include>\n        <objectSet>\n          <pattern type=\"File\">c:\\data\\* [*]</pattern>\n        </objectSet>\n      </include>\n    </rules>\n    <rules>\n      <exclude>\n        <objectSet>\n          <pattern type=\"File\">c:\\* [*.txt]</pattern>\n        </objectSet>\n      </exclude>\n\n    </rules>\n  </role>\n</component>\n```\n\nHowever, upon testing the migration you notice that all the text files are still included in the migration. In order to troubleshoot this issue, the migration can be performed with the environment variable MIG\\_ENABLE\\_DIAG set so that the diagnostic log is generated. Upon searching the diagnostic log for the component “DATA1”, the following XML section is discovered:\n\n``` syntax\n<MigUnitList>\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\" Context=\"System\" ConfidenceLevel=\"100\" Group=\"Applications\" Role=\"UserData\" Agent=\"CMXEAgent\" Selected=\"true\" Supported=\"true\">\n<Patterns Type=\"Include\">\n<Pattern Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\* [*]\"/>\n</Patterns>\n<Patterns Type=\"Exclude\">\n<Pattern Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\* [*.txt]\"/>\n</Patterns>\n</MigUnit>\n</MigUnitList>\n<Perform Name=\"Gather\" User=\"System\">\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\">\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test (1).txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test.docx]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test.txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder [New Text Document.txt]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder [test.docx]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n</MigUnit>\n</Perform>\n```\n\nUpon reviewing the diagnostic log, you confirm that the files are still migrating, and that it is a problem with the authored migration XML rule. You author an update to the migration XML script as follows:\n\n``` syntax\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<migration urlid=\"http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/TestSuite_BUGFIX\">\n\n<component context=\"System\"  type=\"Application\">\n  <displayName>DATA1</displayName>\n  <role role=\"Data\">\n    <rules>\n      <include>\n        <objectSet>\n          <pattern type=\"File\">c:\\data\\* [*]</pattern>\n        </objectSet>\n      </include>\n    </rules>\n    <rules>\n      <exclude>\n        <objectSet>\n          <pattern type=\"File\">c:\\data\\* [*.txt]</pattern>\n        </objectSet>\n      </exclude>\n\n    </rules>\n  </role>\n</component>\n\n\n</migration>\n```\n\nYour revised migration XML script excludes the files from migrating, as confirmed in the diagnostic log:\n\n``` syntax\n<MigUnitList>\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\" Context=\"System\" ConfidenceLevel=\"100\" Group=\"Applications\" Role=\"UserData\" Agent=\"CMXEAgent\" Selected=\"true\" Supported=\"true\">\n<Patterns Type=\"Include\">\n<Pattern Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\* [*]\"/>\n</Patterns>\n<Patterns Type=\"Exclude\">\n<Pattern Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\* [*.txt]\"/>\n</Patterns>\n</MigUnit>\n</MigUnitList>\n<Perform Name=\"Gather\" User=\"System\">\n<MigUnit Name=\"&lt;System&gt;\\DATA1 (CMXEAgent)\">\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data [test.docx]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n<Operation Name=\"Store\" Type=\"File\" Path=\"C:\\data\\New Folder [test.docx]\" SimObj=\"false\" Success=\"true\"/>\n</MigUnit>\n</Perform>\n```\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[XML Elements Library](usmt-xml-elements-library.md)\n\n[ScanState Syntax](usmt-scanstate-syntax.md)\n\n[LoadState Syntax](usmt-loadstate-syntax.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
