Groups\nms.prod: w10\nms.mktglfcycl: deploy\nms.sitesec: library\nms.pagetype: security\n---\n\n# Active Directory Security Groups\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\nThis reference topic for the IT professional describes the default Active Directory security groups.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"w2k3tr-princ-how-eabp\"></a>\n\n\nThere are two forms of common security principals in Active Directory: user accounts and computer accounts. These accounts represent a physical entity (a person or a computer). User accounts can also be used as dedicated service accounts for some applications. Security groups are used to collect user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups into manageable units.\n\nIn the Windows Server operating system, there are several built-in accounts and security groups that are preconfigured with the appropriate rights and permissions to perform specific tasks. For Active Directory, there are two types of administrative responsibilities:\n\n-   **Service administrators**   Responsible for maintaining and delivering Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), including managing domain controllers and configuring the AD DS.\n\n-   **Data administrators**   Responsible for maintaining the data that is stored in AD DS and on domain member servers and workstations.\n\n## About Active Directory groups\n\n\nGroups are used to collect user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups into manageable units. Working with groups instead of with individual users helps simplify network maintenance and administration.\n\nThere are two types of groups in Active Directory:\n\n-   **Distribution groups** Used to create email distribution lists.\n\n-   **Security groups** Used to assign permissions to shared resources.\n\n### Distribution groups\n\nDistribution groups can be used only with email applications (such as Exchange Server) to send email to collections of users. Distribution groups are not security enabled, which means that they cannot be listed in discretionary access control lists (DACLs).\n\n### Security groups\n\nSecurity groups can provide an efficient way to assign access to resources on your network. By using security groups, you can:\n\n-   Assign user rights to security groups in Active Directory.\n\n    User rights are assigned to a security group to determine what members of that group can do within the scope of a domain or forest. User rights are automatically assigned to some security groups when Active Directory is installed to help administrators define a personâ€™s administrative role in the domain.\n\n    For example, a user who is added to the Backup Operators group in Active Directory has the ability to back up and restore files and directories that are located on each domain controller in the domain. This is possible because, by default, the user rights **Backup files and directories** and **Restore files and directories** are automatically assigned to the Backup Operators group. Therefore, members of this group inherit the user rights that are assigned to that group.\n\n    You can use Group Policy to assign user rights to security groups to delegate specific tasks. For more information about using Group Policy, see [User Rights Assignment](user-rights-assignment.md).\n\n-   Assign permissions to security groups for resources.\n\n    Permissions are different than user rights. Permissions are assigned to the security group for the shared resource. Permissions determine who can access the resource and the level of access, such as Full Control. Some permissions that are set on domain objects are automatically assigned to allow various levels of access to default security groups, such as the Account Operators group or the Domain Admins group.\n\n    Security groups are listed in DACLs that define permissions on resources and objects. When assigning permissions for resources (file shares, printers, and so on), administrators should assign those permissions to a security group rather than to individual users. The permissions are assigned once to the group, instead of several times to each individual user. Each account that is added to a group receives the rights that are assigned to that group in Active Directory, and the user receives the permissions that are defined for that group.\n\nLike distribution groups, security groups can be used as an email entity. Sending an email message to the group sends the message to all the members of the group.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-groupscope\"></a>Group scope\n\nGroups are characterized by a scope that identifies the extent to which the group is applied in the domain tree or forest. The scope of the group defines where the group can be granted permissions. The following three group scopes are defined by Active Directory:\n\n-   Universal\n\n-   Global\n\n-   Domain Local\n\n**Note**  \nIn addition to these three scopes, the default groups in the **Builtin** container have a group scope of Builtin Local. This group scope and group type cannot be changed.\n\n \n\nThe following table lists the three group scopes and more information about each scope for a security group.\n\n**Group scopes**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Possible Members</th>\n<th>Scope Conversion</th>\n<th>Can Grant Permissions</th>\n<th>Possible Member of</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Universal</p></td>\n<td><p>Accounts from any domain in the same forest</p>\n<p>Global groups from any domain in the same forest</p>\n<p>Other Universal groups from any domain in the same forest</p></td>\n<td><p>Can be converted to Domain Local scope</p>\n<p>Can be converted to Global scope if the group does not contain any other Universal groups</p></td>\n<td><p>On any domain in the same forest or trusting forests</p></td>\n<td><p>Other Universal groups in the same forest</p>\n<p>Domain Local groups in the same forest or trusting forests</p>\n<p>Local groups on computers in the same forest or trusting forests</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>Global</p></td>\n<td><p>Accounts from the same domain</p>\n<p>Other Global groups from the same domain</p></td>\n<td><p>Can be converted to Universal scope if the group is not a member of any other global group</p></td>\n<td><p>On any domain in the same forest, or trusting domains or forests</p></td>\n<td><p>Universal groups from any domain in the same forest</p>\n<p>Other Global groups from the same domain</p>\n<p>Domain Local groups from any domain in the same forest, or from any trusting domain</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Domain Local</p></td>\n<td><p>Accounts from any domain or any trusted domain</p>\n<p>Global groups from any domain or any trusted domain</p>\n<p>Universal groups from any domain in the same forest</p>\n<p>Other Domain Local groups from the same domain</p>\n<p>Accounts, Global groups, and Universal groups from other forests and from external domains</p></td>\n<td><p>Can be converted to Universal scope if the group does not contain any other Domain Local groups</p></td>\n<td><p>Within the same domain</p></td>\n<td><p>Other Domain Local groups from the same domain</p>\n<p>Local groups on computers in the same domain, excluding built-in groups that have well-known SIDs</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"special-identity-groups-\"></a>Special identity groups\n\nSpecial identities are generally referred to as groups. Special identity groups do not have specific memberships that can be modified, but they can represent different users at different times, depending on the circumstances. Some of these groups include Creator Owner, Batch, and Authenticated User.\n\nFor information about all the special identity groups, see [Special Identities](special-identities.md).\n\n## Default security groups\n\n\nDefault groups, such as the Domain Admins group, are security groups that are created automatically when you create an Active Directory domain. You can use these predefined groups to help control access to shared resources and to delegate specific domain-wide administrative roles.\n\nMany default groups are automatically assigned a set of user rights that authorize members of the group to perform specific actions in a domain, such as logging on to a local system or backing up files and folders. For example, a member of the Backup Operators group has the right to perform backup operations for all domain controllers in the domain.\n\nWhen you add a user to a group, the user receives all the user rights that are assigned to the group and all the permissions that are assigned to the group for any shared resources.\n\nDefault groups are located in the **Builtin** container and in the **Users** container in Active Directory Users and Computers. The **Builtin** container includes groups that are defined with the Domain Local scope. The **Users** includes contains groups that are defined with Global scope and groups that are defined with Domain Local scope. You can move groups that are located in these containers to other groups or organizational units (OU) within the domain, but you cannot move them to other domains.\n\nSome of the administrative groups that are listed in this topic and all members of these groups are protected by a background process that periodically checks for and applies a specific security descriptor. This descriptor is a data structure that contains security information associated with a protected object. This process ensures that any successful unauthorized attempt to modify the security descriptor on one of the administrative accounts or groups will be overwritten with the protected settings.\n\nThe security descriptor is present on the **AdminSDHolder** object. This means that if you want to modify the permissions on one of the service administrator groups or on any of its member accounts, you must modify the security descriptor on the **AdminSDHolder** object so that it will be applied consistently. Be careful when you make these modifications because you are also changing the default settings that will be applied to all of your protected administrative accounts.\n\n### <a href=\"\"

Active Directory provides security across multiple domains or forests through domain and forest trust relationships. Before authentication can occur across trusts, Windows must determine whether the domain being requested by a user, computer, or service has a trust relationship with the logon domain of the requesting account.\n\nTo make this determination, the Windows security system computes a trust path between the domain controller for the server that receives the request and a domain controller in the domain of the requesting account.

Members of this group automatically have non-configurable protection applied to their accounts. Membership in the Protected Users group is meant to be restrictive and proactively secure by default. The only method to modify the protection for an account is to remove the account from the security group.\n\nThis domain-related, global group triggers non-configurable protection on devices and host computers running Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1, and on domain controllers in domains with a primary domain controller running Windows Server 2012 R2. This greatly reduces the memory footprint of credentials when users sign in to computers on the network from a non-compromised computer.\n\nDepending on the accountâ€™s domain functional level, members of the Protected Users group are further protected due to behavior changes in the authentication methods that are supported in Windows.\n\n-   Members of the Protected Users group cannot authenticate by using the following Security Support Providers (SSPs): NTLM, Digest Authentication, or CredSSP. Passwords are not cached on a device running Windows 8.1, so the device fails to authenticate to a domain when the account is a member of the Protected User group.\n\n-   The Kerberos protocol will not use the weaker DES or RC4 encryption types in the preauthentication process. This means that the domain must be configured to support at least the AES cipher suite.\n\n-   The userâ€™s account cannot be delegated with Kerberos constrained or unconstrained delegation. This means that former connections to other systems may fail if the user is a member of the Protected Users group.\n\n-   The default Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) lifetime setting of four hours is configurable by using Authentication Policies and Silos, which can be accessed through the Active Directory Administrative Center. This means that when four hours has passed, the user must authenticate again.\n\nThe Protected Users group applies to versions of the Windows Server operating system listed in the [Active Directory Default Security Groups table](#bkmk-groupstable).\n\nThis group was introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2.

Windows Server operating systems use the File Replication service (FRS) to replicate system policies and logon scripts stored in the System Volume (SYSVOL). Each domain controller keeps a copy of SYSVOL for network clients to access. FRS can also replicate data for the Distributed File System (DFS), synchronizing the content of each member in a replica set as defined by DFS. FRS can copy and maintain shared files and folders on multiple servers simultaneously. When changes occur, content is synchronized immediately within sites and by a schedule between sites.\n\n**Important**  \nIn Windows Server 2008 R2, FRS cannot be used for replicating DFS folders or custom (non-SYSVOL) data. A Windows Server 2008 R2 domain controller can still use FRS to replicate the contents of a SYSVOL shared resource in a domain that uses FRS for replicating the SYSVOL shared resource between domain controllers.\n\nHowever, Windows Server 2008 R2 servers cannot use FRS to replicate the contents of any replica set apart from the SYSVOL shared resource. The DFS Replication service is a replacement for FRS, and it can be used to replicate the contents of a SYSVOL shared resource, DFS folders, and other custom (non-SYSVOL) data. You should migrate all non-SYSVOL FRS replica sets to DFS Replication.
