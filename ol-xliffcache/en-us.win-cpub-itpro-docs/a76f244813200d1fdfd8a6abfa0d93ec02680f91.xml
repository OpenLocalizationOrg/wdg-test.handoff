Therefore, export the policy from the GPO and update the rule or rules by using AppLocker on your AppLocker reference device\n\nTo complete this procedure, you must have the **Edit Setting** permission to edit a GPO. By default, members of the **Domain Admins** group, the **Enterprise Admins** group, and the **Group Policy Creator Owners** group have this permission.\n\n**Export the policy from the GPO**\n\n1.  In the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), open the GPO that you want to edit.\n2.  In the console tree under **Computer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Application Control Policies**, click **AppLocker**.\n3.  Right-click **AppLocker**, and then click **Export Policy**.\n4.  In the **Export Policy** dialog box, type a name for the exported policy (for example, the name of the GPO), select a location to save the policy, and then click **Save**.\n5.  The **AppLocker** dialog box will notify you of how many rules were exported. Click **OK**.\n"}
