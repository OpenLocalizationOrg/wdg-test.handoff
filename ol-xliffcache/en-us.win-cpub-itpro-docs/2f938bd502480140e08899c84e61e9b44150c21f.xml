For more information about importing applications, see [How to Import an Application](how-to-import-an-applicationserver.md).\n\n**To add a package manually**\n\n1.  In the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, right-click the **Packages** node in the left pane and choose **New Package**.\n\n2.  In the **New Package** dialog box, type a name in the **Package Name** field.\n\n3.  Browse for or type a path name in the **Full path for package file** field. This must be an SFT file.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If you browse to the SFT file, replace the local path (such as C:\\\\Program Files\\\\User\\_Apps\\\\Virtual\\_App\\_Server\\\\content) with the server's static host name or IP address. Using the variable *%SFT\\_SOFTGRIDSERVER%* requires per-client computer configuration.\n\n    In dialog boxes that refer to Virtual Application Servers, you must use a network location, such as the server's static host name or IP address, that your users can access. The application's Open Software Descriptor (OSD) file can replace the placeholder variable *%SFT\\_SOFTGRIDSERER%* with the server's static host name or IP address. If you leave the placeholder variable, you must set this variable on each client computer that will access that server. Set a User or System variable on each computer for SFT\\_SOFTGRIDSERVER. The variable value must be the server's static host name or IP address. If you set a variable, exit the Client session, log out of and back into Microsoft Windows, and then restart the session on each computer that had a session running and had the variable set.\n\n     \n\n4.  Click **Next**.\n\n5.  The **Summary** dialog box shows the file location and prompts you to copy the file to the location if you have not already done so. Click **Finish** after you have verified the information.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If you are managing applications on a remote server, in the next dialog box, type only the path of the file relative to the server's content root.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Import an Application](how-to-import-an-applicationserver.md)\n\n[How to Manage Packages in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-packages-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
