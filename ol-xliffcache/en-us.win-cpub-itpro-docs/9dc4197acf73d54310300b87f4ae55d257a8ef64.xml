You can use the following procedure to configure security post-installation.\n\n**To configure Management Server security post-installation**\n\n1.  Open the App-V Management Console, and connect to the **Management Service** with App-V administrator privileges.\n\n2.  Expand the server, expand **Server Groups**, and then select the appropriate server group with which the Management Server was registered.\n\n3.  Right-click the Management Server object, and select **Properties**.\n\n4.  On the **Ports** tab, click **Server Certificate** and complete the wizard to select the properly provisioned certificate.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If no certificates are displayed in the wizard, a certificate has not been provisioned or the certificate does meet the requirements of App-V.\n\n     \n\n5.  Click **Next** to continue on to the **Welcome To Certificate Wizard** page.\n\n6.  Select the correct certificate in the **Available Certificates** screen.\n\n7.  Click **Finish**.\n\n8.  After completing the wizard, clear **RTSP** as an available listening port. This prevents connections from being made over a non-secure communication channel.\n\n9.  Click **Apply**, and restart the **Microsoft Virtual Application Server** service. Use the service’s MMC snap-in to accomplish this task.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Configure Streaming Server Security Post-Installation](how-to-configure-streaming-server-security-post-installation.md)\n\n[Troubleshooting Certificate Permission Issues](troubleshooting-certificate-permission-issues.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
