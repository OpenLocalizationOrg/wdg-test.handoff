# Select Package Accelerator (Learn More) Page


Only run Package Accelerators from publishers that you trust. Package Accelerators usually include a digital signature. A digital signature is an electronic security mark that can help indicate the publisher of the software, and that the package has not been tampered with after the transform was originally signed. If you use a transform that has been digitally signed by a publisher and the publisher has verified its identity with a certification authority, you can be more confident that the transform comes from that specific publisher and has not been altered.

The sequencer notifies you if any of the following conditions are true:

-   The selected transform has not been digitally signed.

-   The selected transform is signed by a publisher that has not verified its identity with a certification authority.

-   The selected transform has been altered after it was digitally signed and released.

If any of these messages are displayed when using a Package Accelerator, visit the Package Accelerators publisherâ€™s website to get a digitally signed version of the transform.
