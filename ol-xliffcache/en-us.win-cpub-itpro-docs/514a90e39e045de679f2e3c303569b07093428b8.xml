Optimize your virtual application packages for performance using the sequencer, and to understand how to use User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) or other user environment management technologies to provide the optimal user experience with App-V 5.1 in both Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).\n\nTo help determine what information is relevant to your environment you should review each section’s brief overview and applicability checklist.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"---------app-v-5-1-in-stateful--non-persistent-deployments\"></a> App-V 5.1 in stateful\\* non-persistent deployments\n\n\nThis section provides information about an approach that helps ensure a user will have access to all virtual applications within seconds after logging in. This is achieved by uniquely addressing the often long-running App-V 5.1 publishing refresh. As you will discover the basis of the approach, the fastest publishing refresh, is one that doesn’t have to actually do anything. A number of conditions must be met and steps followed to provide the optimal user experience.\n\nUse the information in the following section for more information:\n\n[Usage Scenarios](#bkmk-us) - As you review the two scenarios, keep in mind that these are the approach extremes. Based on your usage requirements, you may choose to apply these steps to a subset of users and/or virtual applications packages.\n\n-   Optimized for Performance – To provide the optimal experience, you can expect the base image to include some of the App-V virtual application package. This and other requirements are discussed.\n\n-   Optimized for Storage – If you are concerned with the storage impact, following this scenario will help address those concerns.\n\n[Preparing your Environment](#bkmk-pe)\n\n-   Steps to Prepare the Base Image – Whether in a non-persistent VDI or RDSH environment, only a few steps must be completed in the base image to enable this approach.\n\n-   Use UE-V 2.1 as the User Profile Management (UPM) solution for the App-V approach – the cornerstone of this approach is the ability of a UEM solution to persist the contents of just a few registry and file locations. These locations constitute the user integrations\\*. Be sure to review the specific requirements for the UPM solution.\n\n[User Experience Walk-through](#bkmk-uewt)\n\n-   Walk-through – This is a step-by-step walk-through of the App-V and UE-V operations and the expectations users should have.\n\n-   Outcome – This describes the expected results.\n\n[Impact to Package Lifecycle](#bkmk-plc)\n\n[Enhancing the VDI Experience through Performance Optimization/Tuning](#bkmk-evdi)\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"applicability-checklist-\"></a>Applicability Checklist\n\nDeployment Environment\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><img src=\"images/checklistbox.gif\" alt=\"Checklist box\" /></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Non-Persistent VDI or RDSH.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><img src=\"images/checklistbox.gif\" alt=\"Checklist box\" /></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>User Experience Virtualization (UE-V), other UPM solutions or User Profile Disks (UPD).</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nExpected Configuration\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><img src=\"images/checklistbox.gif\" alt=\"Checklist box\" /></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) with the App-V user state template enabled or User Profile Management (UPM) software.

These settings are then applied to the different computers that are accessed by the user, including desktop computers, laptop computers, and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) sessions. UE-V is optimized for RDS and VDI scenarios.\n\nFor more information see [Getting Started With User Experience Virtualization 2.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn458926.aspx)\n\nIn essence all that is required is to install the UE-V client and download the following Microsoft authored App-V settings template from the [Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) template gallery](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Authored-UE-V-Settings-bb442a33). Register the template. For more information around UE-V templates see [The UE-V specific resource for acquiring and registering the template](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn458926.aspx).\n\n**Note**  \nWithout performing an additional configuration step, the Microsoft User Environment Virtualization (UE-V) will not be able to synchronize the Start menu shortcuts (.lnk files) on the target computer. The .lnk file type is excluded by default.\n\nUE-V will only support removing the .lnk file type from the exclusion list in the RDS and VDI scenarios, where every user’s device will have the same set of applications installed to the same location and every .lnk file is valid for all the users’ devices. For example, UE-V would not currently support the following 2 scenarios, because the net result will be that the shortcut will be valid on one but not all devices.\n\n-   If a user has an application installed on one device with .lnk files enabled and the same native application installed on another device to a different installation root with .lnk files enabled.\n\n-   If a user has an application installed on one device but not another with .lnk files enabled.\n\n \n\n**Important**  \nThis topic describes how to change the Windows registry by using Registry Editor. If you change the Windows registry incorrectly, you can cause serious problems that might require you to reinstall Windows. You should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you change the registry. Microsoft cannot guarantee that the problems that might occur when you change the registry can be resolved. Change the registry at your own risk.\n\n \n\nUsing the Microsoft Registry Editor (regedit.exe), navigate to **HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE** \\\\ **Software** \\\\ **Microsoft** \\\\ **UEV** \\\\ **Agent** \\\\ **Configuration** \\\\ **ExcludedFileTypes** and remove **.lnk** from the excluded file types.\n\n**Configure other User Profile Management (UPM) solution for App-V Approach**\n\nThe expectation in a stateful environment is that a UPM solution is implemented and can support persistence of user data across sessions and between logins.\n\nThe requirements for the UPM solution are as follows.\n\nTo enable an optimized login experience, for example the App-V 5.1 approach for the user, the solution must be capable of:\n\n-   Persisting the below user integrations as part of the user profile/persona.\n\n-   Triggering a user profile sync on login (or application start), which can guarantee that all user integrations are applied before publishing/refresh begin, or,\n\n-   Attaching and detaching a user profile disk (UPD) or similar technology that contains the user integrations.\n\n    **Note**  \n    App-V is supported when using UPD only when the entire profile is stored on the user profile disk.\n\n    App-V packages are not supported when using UPD with selected folders stored in the user profile disk. The Copy on Write driver does not handle UPD selected folders.\n\n     \n\n-   Capturing changes to the locations, which constitute the user integrations, prior to session logoff.\n\nWith App-V 5.1 when you add a publishing server (**Add-AppvPublishingServer**) you can configure synchronization, for example refresh during log on and/or after a specified refresh interval. In both cases a scheduled task is created.\n\nIn previous versions of App-V 5.1, both scheduled tasks were configured using a VBScript that would initiate the user and global refresh. With Hotfix Package 4 for Application Virtualization 5.0 SP2 the user refresh on log on was initiated by **SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe**. This change was introduced to provide UPM solutions a trigger process. This process delays the publish /refresh to allow the UPM solution to apply the user integrations. It will exit once the publishing/refresh is complete.\n\n**User Integrations**\n\nRegistry – HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER\n\n-   Path - Software\\\\Classes\n\n    Exclude: Local Settings, ActivatableClasses, AppX\\*\n\n-   Path - Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\AppV\n\n-   Path- Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\App Paths\n\n**File Locations**\n\n-   Root – “Environment Variable” APPDATA\n\n    Path – Microsoft\\\\AppV\\\\Client\\\\Catalog\n\n-   Root – “Environment Variable” APPDATA\n\n    Path – Microsoft\\\\AppV\\\\Client\\\\Integration\n\n-   Root – “Environment Variable” APPDATA\n\n    Path - Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\n\n-   (To persist all desktop shortcuts, virtual and non-virtual)\n\n    Root - “KnownFolder” {B4BFCC3A-DB2C-424C-B029-7FE99A87C641}FileMask - \\*.lnk\n\n**Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V)**\n\nAdditionally, we recommend using Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) to capture and centralize application settings and Windows operating system settings for a specific user.

To help guarantee users have access to the appropriate upgraded (published) or downgraded (un-published) virtual application packages, it is recommended you update the base image to reflect these changes. To understand why review the following section:\n\nApp-V 5.0 SP2 introduced the concept of pending states. In the past,\n\n-   If an administrator changed entitlements or created a new version of a package (upgraded) and during a publishing/refresh that package was in-use, the un-publish or publish operation, respectively, would fail.\n\n-   Now, if a package is in-use the operation will be pended. The un-publish and publish-pend operations will be processed on service restart or if another publish or un-publish command is issued. In the latter case, if the virtual application is in-use otherwise, the virtual application will remain in a pending state. For globally published packages, a restart (or service restart) often needed.\n\nIn a non-persistent environment, it is unlikely these pended operations will be processed. The pended operations, for example tasks are captured under **HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER** \\\\ **Software** \\\\ **Microsoft** \\\\ **AppV** \\\\ **Client** \\\\ **PendingTasks**. Although this location is persisted by the UPM solution, if it is not applied to the environment prior to log on, it will not be processed.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-evdi\"></a>Enhancing the VDI Experience through Performance Optimization Tuning\n\nThe following section contains lists with information about Microsoft documentation and downloads that may be useful when optimizing your environment for performance.\n\n**.NET NGEN Blog and Script (Highly Recommended)**\n\nAbout NGEN technology\n\n-   [How to speed up NGEN optimaztion](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2013/08/06/wondering-why-mscorsvw-exe-has-high-cpu-usage-you-can-speed-it-up.aspx)\n\n-   [Script](http://aka.ms/DrainNGenQueue)\n\n**Windows Server and Server Roles**\n\nServer Performance Tuning Guidelines for\n\n-   [Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn529133.aspx)\n\n-   [Microsoft Windows Server 2012](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/0/B/00BE76AF-D340-4759-8ECD-C80BC53B6231/performance-tuning-guidelines-windows-server-2012.docx)\n\n-   [Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/B/2/6B2EBD3A-302E-4553-AC00-9885BBF31E21/Perf-tun-srv-R2.docx)\n\n**Server Roles**\n\n-   [Remote Desktop Virtualization Host](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn567643.aspx)\n\n-   [Remote Desktop Session Host](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn567648.aspx)\n\n-   [IIS Relevance: App-V Management, Publishing, Reporting Web Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn567678.aspx)\n\n-   [File Server (SMB) Relevance: If used for App-V Content Storage and Delivery in SCS Mode](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj134210.aspx)\n\n**Windows Client (Guest OS) Performance Tuning Guidance**\n\n-   [Microsoft Windows 7](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/5/7/E5783D68-160B-4366-8387-114FC3E45EB4/Performance Tuning Guidelines for Windows 7 Desktop Virtualization v1.9.docx)\n\n-   [Optimization Script: (Provided by Microsoft Support)](http://blogs.technet.com/b/jeff_stokes/archive/2012/10/15/the-microsoft-premier-field-engineer-pfe-view-on-virtual-desktop-vdi-density.aspx)\n\n-   [Microsoft Windows 8](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/0/1/601D7797-A063-4FA7-A2E5-74519B57C2B4/Windows_8_VDI_Image_Client_Tuning_Guide.pdf)\n\n-   [Optimization Script: (Provided by Microsoft Support)](http://blogs.technet.com/b/jeff_stokes/archive/2013/04/09/hot-off-the-presses-get-it-now-the-windows-8-vdi-optimization-script-courtesy-of-pfe.aspx)\n\n## Sequencing Steps to Optimize Packages for Publishing Performance\n\n\nSeveral App-V features facilitate new scenarios or enable new customer deployment scenarios.

The administrator will be notified and will have the option to exclude the SxS Assembly.\n\n**Client Side**:\n\nWhen publishing a virtual application package, the App-V Client will detect if a required SxS dependency is already installed. If the dependency is unavailable on the computer and it is included in the package, a traditional Windows Insataller (.**msi**) installation of the SxS assembly will be initiated. As previously documented, simply install the dependency on the computer running the client to ensure that the Windows Installer (.msi) installation will not occur.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Step</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Considerations</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Benefits</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Tradeoffs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Selectively Employ Dynamic Configuration files</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The App-V 5.1 client must parse and process these Dynamic Configuration files.</p>\n<p>Be conscious of size and complexity (script execution, VREG inclusions/exclusions) of the file.</p>\n<p>Numerous virtual application packages may already have User- or computer–specific dynamic configurations files.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Publishing times will improve if these files are used selectively or not at all.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Virtual application packages would need to be reconfigured individually or via the App-V server management console to remove associated Dynamic Configuration files.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### Disabling a Dynamic Configuration using Powershell\n\n-   For already published packages, you can use `Set-AppVClientPackage –Name Myapp –Path c:\\Packages\\Apps\\MyApp.appv` without\n\n    **-DynamicDeploymentConfiguration** parameter\n\n-   Similarly, when adding new packages using `Add-AppVClientPackage –Path c:\\Packages\\Apps\\MyApp.appv`, do not use the\n\n    **-DynamicDeploymentConfiguration** parameter.\n\nFor documentation on How to Apply a Dynamic Configuration, see:\n\n-   [How to Apply the User Configuration File by Using PowerShell](how-to-apply-the-user-configuration-file-by-using-powershell51.md)\n\n-   [How to Apply the Deployment Configuration File by Using PowerShell](how-to-apply-the-deployment-configuration-file-by-using-powershell51.md)\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Step</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Considerations</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Benefits</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Tradeoffs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Account for Synchronous Script Execution during Package Lifecycle.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>If script collateral is embedded in the package, Add (Powershell) may be significantly slower.</p>\n<p>Running of scripts during virtual application launch (StartVirtualEnvironment, StartProcess) and/or Add+Publish will impact the perceived performance during one or more of these lifecycle operations.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Use of Asynchronous (Non-Blocking) Scripts will ensure that the lifecycle operations complete efficiently.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>This step requires working knowledge of all virtual application packages with embedded script collateral, which have associated dynamic configurations files and which reference and run scripts synchronously.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Remove Extraneous Virtual Fonts from Package.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The majority of applications investigated by the App-V product team contained a small number of fonts, typically fewer than 20.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Virtual Fonts impact publishing refresh performance.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Desired fonts will need to be enabled/installed natively.

Some example characteristics are: manifest size, number of virtual fonts, number of files.\n\n-   **De-Integrate** – Removes the user integrations\n\n-   **Re-Integrate** – Applies the user integrations.\n\n-   **Non-Persistent, Pooled** – Creates a computer running a virtual environment each time they log in.\n\n-   **Persistent, Personal** – A computer running a virtual environment that remains the same for every login.\n\n-   **Stateful** - For this document, implies that user integrations are persisted between sessions and a user environment management technology is used in conjunction with non-persistent RDSH or VDI.\n\n-   **Stateless** – Represents a scenario when no user state is persisted between sessions.\n\n-   **Trigger** – (or Native Action Triggers). UPM uses these types of triggers to initiate monitoring or synchronization operations.\n\n-   **User Experience** - In the context of App-V 5.1, the user experience, quantitatively, is the sum of the following parts:\n\n    -   From the point that users initiate a log-in to when they are able to manipulate the desktop.\n\n    -   From the point where the desktop can be interacted with to the point a publishing refresh begins (in PowerShell terms, sync) when using the App-V 5.1 full server infrastructure. In standalone instances, it is when the **Add-AppVClientPackage** and **Publish-AppVClientPackage Powershell** commands are initiated.\n\n    -   From start to completion of the publishing refresh. In standalone instances, this is the first to last virtual application published.\n\n    -   From the point where the virtual application is available to launch from a shortcut. Alternatively, it is from the point at which the file type association is registered and will launch a specified virtual application.\n\n-   **User Profile Management** – The controlled and structured approach to managing user components associated with the environment. For example, user profiles, preference and policy management, application control and application deployment. You can use scripting or third-party solutions configure the environment as needed.\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization).
