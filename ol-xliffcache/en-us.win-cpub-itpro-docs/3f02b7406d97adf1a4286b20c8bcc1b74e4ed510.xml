Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) to use the System Center Configuration Manager Integration topology, which integrates MBAM with Configuration Manager.\n\nThe instructions explain how to configure Configuration Manager Integration by using:\n\n-   A Windows PowerShell cmdlet\n\n-   The MBAM Server Configuration wizard\n\nThe instructions are based on the recommended architecture in [High-Level Architecture for MBAM 2.5](high-level-architecture-for-mbam-25.md).\n\n**Before you start the configuration:**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col

PowerShell**\n\n1.  Before you start the configuration, see [Configuring MBAM 2.5 Server Features by Using Windows PowerShell](configuring-mbam-25-server-features-by-using-windows-powershell.md) to review the prerequisites for using Windows PowerShell.\n\n2.  Use the **Enable-MbamCMIntegration** Windows PowerShell cmdlet to configure the Reports. To get information about this cmdlet, type **Get-Help Enable-MbamCMIntegration**.\n\n**To configure the System Center Configuration Manager Integration by using the wizard**\n\n1.  On the server where you want to configure the System Center Configuration Manager Integration feature, start the MBAM Server Configuration wizard. You can select **MBAM Server Configuration** from the **Start** menu to open the wizard.\n\n2.  Click **Add New Features**, select **System Center Configuration Manager Integration**, and then click **Next**.\n\n    The wizard checks that all prerequisites for the Configuration Manager Integration have been met.\n\n3.  If the prerequisite check is successful, click **Next** to continue. Otherwise, resolve any missing prerequisites, and then click **Check prerequisites again**.\n\n4.  Use the following descriptions to enter the field values in the wizard:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Field</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><strong>SQL Server Reporting Services server</strong></p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server with the Reporting Service point role.

On the **Summary** page, review the features that will be added.\n\n    **Note**  \n    To create a Windows PowerShell script of the entries you just made, click **Export PowerShell Script** and save the script.\n\n     \n\n6.  Click **Add** to add the Configuration Manager Integration feature to the server, and then click **Close**.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for MBAM**?
