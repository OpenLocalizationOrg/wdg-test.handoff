make informed decisions about how you can configure telemetry in your organization. Telemetry is a term that means different things to different people and organizations. For the purpose of this article, we discuss telemetry as system data that is uploaded by the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component. The telemetry data is used to keep Windows devices secure, and to help Microsoft improve the quality of Windows and Microsoft services.\n\n>**Note:**  This article does not apply to System Center Configuration Manager, System Center Endpoint Protection, or System Center Data Protection Manager because those components use a different telemetry service than Windows and Windows Server.\n\nIt describes the types of telemetry we gather and the ways you can manage its telemetry. This article also lists some examples of how telemetry can provide you with valuable insights into your enterprise deployments, and how Microsoft uses the data to quickly identify and address issues affecting its customers.\n\nWe understand that the privacy and security of our customers’ information is important and we have taken a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to customer privacy and the protection of their data with Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, and System Center 2016.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn previous versions of Windows and Windows Server, Microsoft used telemetry to check for updated or new Windows Defender signatures, check whether Windows Update installations were successful, gather reliability information through the Reliability Analysis Component (RAC) on Windows Server, and gather reliability information through the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) on Windows. In Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, you can control telemetry streams by using Settings &gt; Privacy, Group Policy, or MDM.\n\nMicrosoft is committed to improving customer experiences in a mobile-first and cloud-first world, and it all starts with our customers. Telemetry is one critical way Microsoft is using data to improve our products and services. Telemetry gives every enterprise customer a voice that helps us shape future versions of Windows, Windows Server and System Center, allowing us to respond quickly to your feedback and providing new features and improved quality to our customers.\n\nOur goal is to leverage the aggregated data to drive changes in the product and ecosystem to improve our customer experiences. We are also partnering with enterprises to provide added value from the telemetry information shared by their devices. Some examples include identifying outdated patches and downloading the latest antimalware signatures to help keep their devices secure, identifying application compatibility issues prior to upgrades, and gaining insights into driver reliability issues affecting other customers.\n\nFor Windows 10, we invite IT pros to join the [Windows Insider Program](http://insider.windows.com) to give us feedback on what we can do to make Windows work better for your organization.\n\n## How is telemetry data handled by Microsoft?\n\n### Data collection\n\nWindows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview includes the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component, which uses Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) tracelogging technology to gather and store telemetry events and data. The operating system and some Microsoft management solutions, such as System Center, use the same logging technology.\n\n1. Operating system features and some management applications are instrumented to publish events and data. Examples of management applications include Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), Server Manager, and Storage Spaces.\n2. Events are gathered using public operating system event logging and tracing APIs.\n3. You can configure the telemetry level by using an MDM policy, Group Policy, or registry settings.\n4. The Connected User Experience and Telemetry component transmits telemetry data over HTTPS to Microsoft and uses certificate pinning.\n\nInfo collected at the Enhanced and Full levels of telemetry is typically gathered at a fractional sampling rate, which can be as low as 1% of devices reporting data at those levels.\n\n### Data transmission\n\nAll telemetry data is encrypted using SSL and uses certificate pinning during transfer from the device to the Microsoft Data Management Service. With Windows 10, data is uploaded on a schedule that is sensitive to event priority, battery use, and network cost. Real-time events, such as Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, are always sent immediately. Normal events are not uploaded on metered networks, unless you are on a metered server connection. On a free network, normal events can be uploaded every 4 hours if on battery, or every 15 minutes if on A/C power. Diagnostic and crash data are only uploaded on A/C power and free networks.\n\n### Endpoints\n\nThe Microsoft Data Management Service routes data back to our secure cloud storage. Only Microsoft personnel with a valid business justification are permitted access.\n\nThe Connected User Experience and Telemetry component connects to the Microsoft Data Management service at v10.vortex-win.data.microsoft.com.\n\nThe Connected User Experience and Telemetry component also connects to settings-win.data.microsoft.com to download configuration information.\n\n[Windows Error Reporting](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb513641.aspx) connects to watson.telemetry.microsoft.com.\n\n[Online Crash Analysis](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee416349.aspx) connects to oca.telemetry.microsoft.com.\n\n### Data use and access\n\nData gathered from telemetry is used by Microsoft teams primarily to improve our customer experiences, and for security, health, quality, and performance analysis. The principle of least privileged guides access to telemetry data.  Only Microsoft personnel with a valid business need are permitted access to the telemetry data. Microsoft does not share personal data of our customers with third parties, except at the customer’s discretion or for the limited purposes described in the Privacy Statement. We do share business reports with OEMs and third party partners that include aggregated, anonymized telemetry information. Data-sharing decisions are made by an internal team including privacy, legal, and data management.\n\n### Retention\n\nMicrosoft believes in and practices information minimization. We strive to gather only the info we need, and store it for as long as it’s needed to provide a service or for analysis. Much of the info about how Windows and apps are functioning is deleted within 30 days. Other info may be retained longer, such as error reporting data or Store purchase history. \n\n## Telemetry levels\n\n\nThis section explains the different telemetry levels in Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, and System Center. These levels are available on all desktop and mobile editions of Windows 10, with the exception of the **Security** level which is limited to Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Education, Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise, Windows 10 IoT Core (IoT Core), and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview.\n\nThe telemetry data is categorized into four levels:\n\n-   **Security**. Information that’s required to help keep Windows, Windows Server, and System Center secure, including data about the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component settings, the Malicious Software Removal Tool, and Windows Defender.\n\n-   **Basic**. Basic device info, including: quality-related data, app compat, app usage data, and data from the **Security** level.\n\n-   **Enhanced**. Additional insights, including: how Windows, Windows Server, System Center, and apps are used, how they perform, advanced reliability data, and data from both the **Basic** and the **Security** levels.\n\n-   **Full**. All data necessary to identify and help to fix problems, plus data from the **Security**, **Basic**, and **Enhanced** levels.\n\nThe levels are cumulative and are illustrated in the following diagram. These levels apply to all editions of Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview.\n\n![breakdown of telemetry levels and types of administrative controls](images/priv-telemetry-levels.png)\n\n### Security level\n\nThe Security level gathers only the telemetry info that is required to keep Windows devices, Windows Server, and guests secure with the latest security updates. This level is only available on Windows Server 2016, Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Education, Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise, and IoT Core editions.\n\n> **Note:**  If your organization relies on Windows Update for updates, you shouldn’t use the **Security** level. Because no Windows Update information is gathered at this level, important information about update failures is not sent. Microsoft uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the quality of our updates.\n\nWindows Server Update Services (WSUS) and System Center Configuration Manager functionality is not affected at this level, nor is telemetry data about Windows Server features or System Center gathered.\n\n \n\nThe data gathered at this level includes:\n\n-   **Connected User Experience and Telemetry component settings**. If data has been gathered and is queued to be sent, the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component downloads its settings file from Microsoft’s servers. The data gathered by the client for this request includes OS information, device id (used to identify what specific device is requesting settings) and device class (for example, whether the device is server or desktop).\n\n-   **Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT)** The MSRT infection report contains information, including device info and IP address.\n\n    >**Note:**  You can turn off the MSRT infection report. No MSRT information is included if MSRT is not used. If Windows Update is turned off, MSRT will not be offered to users. For more info, see Microsoft KB article [891716](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/891716).\n\n     \n\n-   **Windows Defender/Endpoint Protection**. Windows Defender and System Center Endpoint Protection requires some information to function, including: anti-malware signatures, diagnostic information, User Account Control settings, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) settings, and IP address.\n\n    **Note**  \n    This reporting can be turned off and no information is included if a customer is using third party antimalware software, or if Windows Defender is turned off. For more info, see [Windows Defender](disconnect-your-organization-from-microsoft.md#windows-defender).\n\n    Microsoft recommends that Windows Update, Windows Defender, and MSRT remain enabled unless the enterprise uses alternative solutions such as Windows Server Update Services, System Center Configuration Manager, or a third party antimalware solution. Windows Update, Windows Defender, and MSRT provide core Windows functionality such as driver and OS updates, including security updates.\n\n     \n\nFor servers with default telemetry settings and no Internet connectivity, you should set the telemetry level to **Security**. This stops data gathering for events that would not be uploaded due to the lack of Internet connectivity.\n\nNo user content, such as user files or communications, is gathered at the **Security** telemetry level, and we take steps to avoid gathering any information that directly identifies a company or user, such as name, email address, or account ID. However, in rare circumstances, MSRT information may unintentionally contain personal information. For instance, some malware may create entries in a computer’s registry that include information such as a username, causing it to be gathered. MSRT reporting is optional and can be turned off at any time.\n\n### Basic level\n\nThe Basic level gathers a limited set of data that’s critical for understanding the device and its configuration. This level also includes the **Security** level data. This level helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. The Connected User Experience and Telemetry component does not gather telemetry data about System Center, but it can transmit telemetry for other non-Windows applications if they have user consent.\n\nThe data gathered at this level includes:\n\n-   **Basic device data**. Helps provide an understanding about the types of Windows devices and the configurations and types of native and virtualized Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview instances in the ecosystem, including:\n\n    -   Device attributes, such as camera resolution and display type\n\n    -   Internet Explorer version\n\n    -   Battery attributes, such as capacity and type\n\n    -   Networking attributes, such as number of network adapters, speed of network adapters, mobile operator network, and IMEI number\n\n    -   Processor and memory attributes, such as number of cores, architecture, speed, memory size, and firmware\n\n    -   Virtualization attribute, such as Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) support and guest operating system\n\n    -   Operating system attributes, such as Windows edition and virtualization state\n\n    -   Storage attributes, such as number of drives, type, and size\n\n-   **Connected User Experience and Telemetry component quality metrics**. Helps provide an understanding about how the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component is functioning, including % of uploaded events, dropped events, and the last upload time.\n\n-   **Quality-related information**. Helps Microsoft develop a basic understanding of how a device and its operating system are performing. Some examples are the device characteristics of a Connected Standby device, the number of crashes or hangs, and application state change details, such as how much processor time and memory were used, and the total uptime for an app.\n\n-   **Compatibility data**. Helps provide an understanding about which apps are installed on a device or virtual machine and identifies potential compatibility problems.\n\n    -   **General app data and app data for Internet Explorer add-ons**. Includes a list of apps that are installed on a native or virtualized instance of the OS and whether these apps function correctly after an upgrade. This app data includes the app name, publisher, version, and basic details about which files have been blocked from usage.\n\n    -   **App usage data**. Includes how an app is used, including how long an app is used for, when the app has focus, and when the app is started\n\n    -   **Internet Explorer add-ons**. Includes a list of Internet Explorer add-ons that are installed on a device and whether these apps will work after an upgrade.\n\n    -   **System data**. Helps provide an understanding about whether a device meets the minimum requirements to upgrade to the next version of the operating system. System information includes the amount of memory, as well as information about the processor and BIOS.\n\n    -   **Accessory device data**. Includes a list of accessory devices, such as printers or external storage devices, that are connected to Windows PCs and whether these devices will function after upgrading to a new version of the operating system.\n\n    -   **Driver data**. Includes specific driver usage that’s meant to help figure out whether apps and devices will function after upgrading to a new version of the operating system. This can help to determine blocking issues and then help Microsoft and our partners apply fixes and improvements.\n\n-   **Store**. Provides information about how the Windows Store performs, including app downloads, installations, and updates. It also includes Windows Store launches, page views, suspend and resumes, and obtaining licenses.\n\n### Enhanced level\n\nThe Enhanced level gathers data about how Windows and apps are used and how they perform. This level also includes data from both the **Basic** and **Security** levels. This level helps to improve the user experience with the operating system and apps. Data from this level can be abstracted into patterns and trends that can help Microsoft determine future improvements.\n\nThis is the default level, and the minimum level needed to quickly identify and address Windows, Windows Server, and System Center quality issues.\n\nThe data gathered at this level includes:\n\n-   **Operating system events**. Helps to gain insights into different areas of the operating system, including networking, Hyper-V, Cortana, storage, file system, and other components.\n\n-   **Operating system app events**. A set of events resulting from Microsoft applications and management tools that were downloaded from the Store or pre-installed with Windows or Windows Server, including Server Manager, Photos, Mail, and Microsoft Edge.\n\n-   **Device-specific events**. Contains data about events that are specific to certain devices, such as Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. For example, Microsoft HoloLens sends Holographic Processing Unit (HPU)-related events.\n\n-   **Some crash dump types**. All crash dump types, except for heap dumps and full dumps.\n\nIf the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component detects a problem on Windows 10 that requires gathering more detailed instrumentation, the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component at the **Enhanced** telemetry level will only gather data about the events associated with the specific issue.\n\n### Full level\n\nThe Full level gathers data necessary to identify and to help fix problems, following the approval process described below. This level also includes data from the **Basic**, **Enhanced**, and **Security** levels.\n\nAdditionally, at this level, devices opted in to the [Windows Insider Program](http://insider.windows.com) will send events, such as reliability and app responsiveness. that can show Microsoft how pre-release binaries and features are performing. These events help us make decisions on which builds are flighted. All devices in the [Windows Insider Program](http://insider.windows.com) are automatically set to this level.\n\nIf a device experiences problems that are difficult to identify or repeat using Microsoft’s internal testing, additional data becomes necessary. This data can include any user content that might have triggered the problem and is gathered from a small sample of devices that have both opted into the **Full** telemetry level and have exhibited the problem.\n\nHowever, before more data is gathered, Microsoft’s privacy governance team, including privacy and other subject matter experts, must approve the diagnostics request made by a Microsoft engineer. If the request is approved, Microsoft engineers can use the following capabilities to get the information:\n\n-   Ability to run a limited, pre-approved list of Microsoft certified diagnostic tools, such as msinfo32.exe, powercfg.exe, and dxdiag.exe.\n\n-   Ability to get registry keys.\n\n-   All crash dump types, including heap dumps and full dumps.\n\n### Manage your telemetry settings\n\nWe do not recommend that you turn off telemetry in your organization as valuable functionality may be impacted, but we recognize that in some scenarios this may be required. Use the steps in this section to do so for Windows, Windows Server, and System Center.\n\n>**Important:**  These telemetry levels only apply to Windows, Windows Server, and System Center components and apps that use the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component. Non-Windows components, such as Microsoft Office or other 3rd-party apps, may communicate with their cloud services outside of these telemetry levels. You should work with your app vendors to understand their telemetry policy, and how you can to opt in or opt out. For more information on how Microsoft Office uses telemetry, see [Overview of Office Telemetry](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj863580.aspx).\n\nYou can turn on or turn off System Center telemetry gathering. The default is on and the data gathered at this level represents what is gathered by default when System Center telemetry is turned on. However, setting the operating system telemetry level to **Basic** will turn off System Center telemetry, even if the System Center telemetry switch is turned on.\n\nThe lowest telemetry setting level supported through management policies is **Security**. The lowest telemetry setting supported through the Settings UI is **Basic**. The default telemetry setting for Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview is **Enhanced.**\n\n### Configure the operating system telemetry level\n\nYou can configure your operating system telemetry settings using the management tools you’re already using, such as Group Policy, MDM, or Windows Provisioning. You can also manually change your settings using Registry Editor. Setting your telemetry levels through a management policy overrides any device level settings.\n\nUse the appropriate value in the table below when you configure the management policy.\n\n| Value | Level    | Data gathered                                                                                                             |\n|-------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **0** | Security | Security data only.                                                                                                       |\n| **1** | Basic    | Security data, and basic system and quality data.                                                                         |\n| **2** | Enhanced | Security data, basic system and quality data, and enhanced insights and advanced reliability data.                        |\n| **3** | Full     | Security data, basic system and quality data, enhanced insights and advanced reliability data, and full diagnostics data. |\n\n \n\n### Use Group Policy to set the telemetry level\n\nUse a Group Policy object to set your organization’s telemetry level.\n\n1.  From the Group Policy Management Console, go to **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components** &gt; **Data Collection and Preview Builds**.\n\n2.  Double-click **Allow Telemetry**.\n\n3.  In the **Options** box, select the level that you want to configure, and then click **OK**.\n\n### Use MDM to set the telemetry level\n\nUse the [Policy Configuration Service Provider (CSP)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962.aspx) to apply the System/AllowTelemetry MDM policy.\n\n### Use Registry Editor to set the telemetry level\n\nUse Registry Editor to manually set the registry level on each device in your organization, or write a script to edit the registry. If a management policy already exists, such as Group Policy or MDM, it will override this registry setting.\n\n1.  Open Registry Editor, and go to **HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\DataCollection**.\n\n2.  Right-click **DataCollection**, click New, and then click **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.\n\n3.  Type **AllowTelemetry**, and then press ENTER.\n\n4.  Double-click **AllowTelemetry**, set the desired value from the table above, and then click **OK.**\n\n5.  Click **File** &gt; **Export**, and then save the file as a .reg file, such as **C:\\\\AllowTelemetry.reg**. You can run this file from a script on each device in your organization.\n\n### Configure System Center 2016 telemetry\n\nFor System Center 2016 Technical Preview, you can turn off System Center telemetry by following these steps:\n\n-   Turn off telemetry by using the System Center UI Console settings workspace.\n\n-   For information about turning off telemetry for Service Management Automation and Service Provider Foundation, see [How to disable telemetry for Service Management Automation and Service Provider Foundation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3096505).\n\n### Additional telemetry controls\n\nThere are a few more settings that you can turn off that may send telemetry information:\n\n-   To turn off Windows Update telemetry, you have two choices. Either turn off Windows Update, or set your devices to be managed by an on premises update server, such as [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh852345.aspx) or [System Center Configuration Manager](http://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/system-center-2012-r2-configuration-manager/).\n\n-   Turn off **Windows Defender Cloud-based Protection** and **Automatic sample submission** in **Settings** &gt; **Update & security** &gt; **Windows Defender**.\n\n-   Manage the Malicious Software Removal Tool in your organization. For more info, see Microsoft KB article [891716](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/891716).\n\n-   Turn off **Linguistic Data Collection** in **Settings** &gt; **Privacy**. At telemetry levels **Enhanced** and **Full**, Microsoft uses Linguistic Data Collection info to improve language model features such as autocomplete, spellcheck, suggestions, input pattern recognition, and dictionary.\n\n    >**Note:**  Microsoft does not intend to gather sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, usernames and passwords, email addresses, or other similarly sensitive information for Linguistic Data Collection. We guard against such events by using technologies to identify and remove sensitive information before linguistic data is sent from the user's device. If we determine that sensitive information has been inadvertently received, we delete the information.\n\n     \n\n## Examples of how Microsoft uses the telemetry data\n\n\n### Drive higher application and driver quality in the ecosystem\n\nTelemetry plays an important role in quickly identifying and fixing critical reliability and security issues in our customers’ deployments and configurations. Insights into the telemetry data we gather helps us to quickly identify crashes or hangs associated with a certain application or driver on a given configuration, like a particular storage type (for example, SCSI) or a memory size. For System Center, job usages and statuses can also help us enhance the job workload and the communication between System Center and its managed products. Microsoft’s ability to get this data from customers and drive improvements into the ecosystem helps raise the bar for the quality of System Center, Windows Server applications, Windows apps, and drivers. Real-time data about Windows installations reduces downtime and the cost associated with troubleshooting unreliable drivers or unstable applications.\n\n### Reduce your total cost of ownership and downtime\n\nTelemetry provides a view of which features and services customers use most. For example, the telemetry data provides us with a heat map of the most commonly deployed Windows Server roles, most used Windows features, and which ones are used the least. This helps us make informed decisions on where we should invest our engineering resources to build a leaner operating system. For System Center, understanding the customer environment for management and monitoring will help drive the support compatibilities matrix, such as host and guest OS. This can help you use existing hardware to meet your business needs and reduce your total cost of ownership, as well as reducing downtime associated with security updates.\n\n### Build features that address our customers’ needs\n\nTelemetry also helps us better understand how customers deploy components, use features, and use services to achieve their business goals. Getting insights from that information helps us prioritize our engineering investments in areas that can directly affect our customers’ experiences and workloads. Some examples include customer usage of containers, storage, and networking configurations associated with Windows Server roles like Clustering and Web. Another example could be to find out when is CPU hyper-threading turned off and the resulting impact. We use the insights to drive improvements and intelligence into some of our management and monitoring solutions, to help customers diagnose quality issues, and save money by making fewer help calls to Microsoft."}
