However, using Office coexistence is not recommended by Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft’s recommended best practice is to avoid Office coexistence completely to prevent compatibility issues. However, when you are migrating to a newer version of Office, issues occasionally arise that can’t be resolved immediately, so you can temporarily implement coexistence to help facilitate a faster migration to the latest product version. Using Office coexistence on a long-term basis is never recommended, and your organization should have a plan to fully transition in the immediate future.\n\n### Before you implement Office coexistence\n\nBefore implementing Office coexistence, review the following Office documentation. Choose the article that corresponds to the newest version of Office for which you plan to implement coexistence.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Office version</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Link to guidance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Office 2013</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Information about how to use Office 2013 suites and programs (MSI deployment) on a computer that is running another version of Office](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784668)</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Office 2010</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Information about how to use Office 2010 suites and programs on a computer that is running another version of Office](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2121447)</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nThe Office documentation provides extensive guidance on coexistence for Windows Installer-based (MSi) and Click-to-Run installations of Office. This App-V topic on coexistence supplements the Office guidance with information that is more specific to App-V deployments.\n\n### Supported Office coexistence scenarios\n\nThe following tables summarize the supported coexistence scenarios. They are organized according to the version and deployment method you’re starting with and the version and deployment method you are migrating to. Be sure to fully test all coexistence solutions before deploying them to a production audience.\n\n**Note**  \nMicrosoft does not support the use of multiple versions of Office in Windows Server environments that have the Remote Desktop Session Host role service enabled. To run Office coexistence scenarios, you must disable this role service.\n\n \n\n### Windows integrations & Office coexistence\n\nThe Windows Installer-based and Click-to-Run Office installation methods integrate with certain points of the underlying Windows operating system. When you use coexistence, common operating system integrations between two Office versions can conflict, causing compatibility and user experience issues. With App-V, you can sequence certain versions of Office to exclude integrations, thereby “isolating” them from the operating system.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mode in which App-V can sequence this version of Office</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Office 2007</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Always non-integrated.

Windows operating system integrations cannot be disabled.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nMicrosoft recommends that you deploy Office coexistence with only one integrated Office instance. For example, if you’re using App-V to deploy Office 2010 and Office 2013, you should sequence Office 2010 in non-integrated mode. For more information about sequencing Office in non-integration (isolated) mode, see [How to sequence Microsoft Office 2010 in Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2830069).\n\n### Known limitations of Office coexistence scenarios\n\nThe following sections describe some issues that you might encounter when using App-V to implement coexistence with Office.\n\n### Limitations common to Windows Installer-based/Click-to-Run and App-V Office coexistence scenarios\n\nThe following limitations can occur when you install the following versions of Office on the same computer:\n\n-   Office 2010 by using the Windows Installer-based version\n\n-   Office 2013 by using App-V\n\nAfter you publish Office 2013 by using App-V side by side with an earlier version of the Windows Installer-based Office 2010 might also cause the Windows Installer to start. This is because the Windows Installer-based or Click-to-Run version of Office 2010 is trying to automatically register itself to the computer.\n\nTo bypass the auto-registration operation for native Word 2010, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Exit Word 2010.\n\n2.  Start the Registry Editor by doing the following:\n\n    -   In Windows 7: Click **Start**, type **regedit** in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.\n\n    -   In Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, type **regedit** press Enter on the Start page and then press Enter.\n\n    If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click **Continue**.\n\n3.  Locate and then select the following registry subkey:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Word\\Options\n    ```\n\n4.  On the **Edit** menu, click **New**, and then click **DWORD Value**.\n\n5.  Type **NoReReg**, and then press Enter.\n\n6.  Right-click **NoReReg** and then click **Modify**.\n\n7.  In the **Valuedata** box, type **1**, and then click **OK**.\n\n8.  On the File menu, click **Exit** to close Registry Editor.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-office-integration-win\"></a>How Office integrates with Windows when you use App-V to deploy Office\n\n\nWhen you deploy Office 2013 by using App-V, Office is fully integrated with the operating system, which provides end users with the same features and functionality as Office has when it is deployed without App-V.\n\nThe Office 2013 App-V package supports the following integration points with the Windows operating system:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\"
