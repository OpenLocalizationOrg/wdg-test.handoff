has problems starting as expected. By using DaRT 10, you can recover end-user computers that have become unusable, diagnose probable causes of issues, and quickly repair unbootable or locked-out computers. When it is necessary, you can also quickly restore important lost files and detect and remove malware, even when the computer is not online.\n\nDaRT 10 lets you create a DaRT recovery image in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Windows Imaging (WIM) file formats and burn the image to a CD, DVD, or USB. You can then use the recovery image files and deploy them locally or to a remote partition or a recovery partition.\n\nDaRT 10 is an important part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP), a dynamic solution available to Software Assurance customers that helps reduce software installation costs, enables delivery of applications as services, and helps manage and control enterprise desktop environments.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"getting-started-with-dart-10\"></a>[Getting Started with DaRT 10](getting-started-with-dart-10.md)  \n\n[About DaRT 10](about-dart-10.md)**|**[Release Notes for DaRT 10](release-notes-for-dart-10.md)**|**[Overview of the Tools in DaRT 10](overview-of-the-tools-in-dart-10.md)**|**[Accessibility for DaRT 10](accessibility-for-dart-10.md)\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"planning-for-dart-10\"></a>[Planning for DaRT 10](planning-for-dart-10.md)  \n\n[Planning to Deploy DaRT 10](planning-to-deploy-dart-10.md)**|**[DaRT 10 Supported Configurations](dart-10-supported-configurations.md)**|**[Planning to Create the DaRT 10 Recovery Image](planning-to-create-the-dart-10-recovery-image.md)**|**[Planning How to Save and Deploy the DaRT 10 Recovery Image](planning-how-to-save-and-deploy-the-dart-10-recovery-image.md)**|**[DaRT 10 Planning Checklist](dart-10-planning-checklist.md)\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"deploying-dart-10\"></a>[Deploying DaRT 10](deploying-dart-10.md)  \n\n[Deploying DaRT 10 to Administrator Computers](deploying-dart-10-to-administrator-computers.md)**|**[Creating the DaRT 10 Recovery Image](creating-the-dart-10-recovery-image.md)**|**[Deploying the DaRT Recovery Image](deploying-the-dart-recovery-image-dart-10.md)**|**[DaRT 10 Deployment Checklist](dart-10-deployment-checklist.md)\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"operations-for-dart-10\"></a>[Operations for DaRT 10](operations-for-dart-10.md)  \n\n[Recovering Computers Using DaRT 10](recovering-computers-using-dart-10.md)**|**[Diagnosing System Failures with Crash Analyzer](diagnosing-system-failures-with-crash-analyzer-dart-10.md)**|**[Security and Privacy for DaRT 10](security-and-privacy-for-dart-10.md)**|**[Administering DaRT 10 Using PowerShell](administering-dart-10-using-powershell.md)\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"troubleshooting-dart-10\"></a>[Troubleshooting DaRT 10](troubleshooting-dart-10.md)  \n\n### More Information\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-do-i-get-mdop\"></a>[How Do I Get MDOP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=322049)  \nGet information about how to download DaRT.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"release-notes-for-dart-10\"></a>[Release Notes for DaRT 10](release-notes-for-dart-10.md)  \nView updated product information and known issues for DaRT 10.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"mdop-techcenter-page\"></a>[MDOP TechCenter Page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=225286)  \nLearn about the latest MDOP information and resources.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"mdop-information-experience\"></a>[MDOP Information Experience](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=236032)  \nFind documentation, videos, and other resources for MDOP technologies.
