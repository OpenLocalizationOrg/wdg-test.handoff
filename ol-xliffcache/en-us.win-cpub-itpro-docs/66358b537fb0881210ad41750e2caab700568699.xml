Applications with this rating receive five green bars.\n\n-   **Works with minor issues or has solutions**. Applications with this rating receive three light-green bars.\n\n-   **Does not work**. Applications with this rating receive a single red bar.\n\nThe color gradient from one to five bars shows the average rating.\n\n![act community](images/dep-win8-e-act-communityexample.gif)\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Selecting Your Compatibility Rating](selecting-your-compatibility-rating.md)\n\n[Analyzing Your Compatibility Data](analyzing-your-compatibility-data.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
