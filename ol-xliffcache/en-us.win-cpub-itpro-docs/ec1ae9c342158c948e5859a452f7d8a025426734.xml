If you see this event, we recommend checking settings in the GPOs from **GPO List** and resolving the cause of the errors.\n\n-   If you have a pre-defined list of Group Policy Objects that contain Security Settings and that must be applied to specific computers, check this event to see if errors occurred when the Security Settings were applied. If so, you can review the error codes and investigate the cause of the failure.\n\n-   Typically this event has an informational purpose and the reason is configuration errors in Group Policy’s security settings.\n\n-   This event might be used for Group Policy troubleshooting purposes.\n\n"}
