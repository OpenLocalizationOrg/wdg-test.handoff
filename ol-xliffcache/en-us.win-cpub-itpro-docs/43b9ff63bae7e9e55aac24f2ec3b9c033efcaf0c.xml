App-V 5.0 you can migrate your existing App-V 4.6 infrastructure to the more flexible, integrated, and easier to manage App-V 5.0 infrastructure.\n\nConsider the following sections when you plan your migration strategy:\n\n**Note**  \nFor more information about the differences between App-V 4.6 and App-V 5.0, see the **Differences between App-V 4.6 and App-V 5.0 section** of [About App-V 5.0](about-app-v-50.md).\n\n \n\n## Converting packages created using a prior version of App-V\n\n\nUse the package converter utility to upgrade virtual application packages created using previous versions of App-V. The package converter uses PowerShell to convert packages and can help automate the process if you have many packages that require conversion.\n\n**Important**  \nAfter you convert an existing package you should test the package prior to deploying the package to ensure the conversion process was successful.\n\n \n\n**What to know before you convert existing packages**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Issue</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Workaround</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Package scripts are not converted.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Test the converted package.
