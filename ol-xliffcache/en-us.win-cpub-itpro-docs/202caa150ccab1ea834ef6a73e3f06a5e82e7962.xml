Control), you can delegate the management of a controlled Group Policy object (GPO), so selected groups and Editors can edit it, Reviewers can review it, and Approvers can approve it.\n\nA user account with the AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role, the user account of the Approver who created the GPO, or a user account with the necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To delegate the management of a controlled GPO**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click the **Controlled** tab to display controlled GPOs, and then click the GPO to delegate.\n\n3.  Click the **Add** button, select the users or groups to be permitted access, and then click **OK**.\n\n4.  To customize the permissions for each user or group, click the **Advanced** button on the **Contents** tab and check role permissions to allow or deny. (For more detailed control, click **Advanced** in the **Permissions** dialog box.)\n\n5.  Click **Apply**, and then click **OK** in the **Permissions** dialog box.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be the Approver who created or controlled the GPO or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** permission for the domain and **Modify Security** permission for the GPO.\n\n-   To delegate read access to Group Policy administrators who use AGPM, you must grant them **List Contents** as well as **Read Settings** permissions. This enables them to view GPOs on the **Contents** tab of AGPM. Set the permission to apply to **This object and nested objects**. Other permissions must be explicitly delegated.\n\n-   Editors must have **Read** permission for the deployed copy of a GPO to make full use of Group Policy Software Installation.\n\n-   Membership in the Group Policy Creator Owners group should be restricted so that it is not used to circumvent AGPM management of access to GPOs. (In the **Group Policy Management Console**, click **Group Policy Objects** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs, click **Delegation**, and then configure the settings to meet the needs of your organization.)\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Performing AGPM Administrator Tasks](performing-agpm-administrator-tasks.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
