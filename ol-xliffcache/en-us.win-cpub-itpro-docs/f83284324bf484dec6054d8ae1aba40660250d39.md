# Microsoft Surface Dock Updater


This article provides a detailed walkthrough of Microsoft Surface Dock Updater.

The [Microsoft Surface Dock Updater](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618121) tool allows you to check the firmware status of a Surface Dock and to manually update the firmware of Surface Dock devices. It is most often used to update Surface Docks prior to deployment of those Surface Docks to end users or as a troubleshooting tool. Microsoft Surface Dock Updater walks you through the process of updating the firmware on one or more Surface Docks, including the required connect and disconnect steps to perform the complete firmware installation.

When you run the Microsoft Surface Dock Updater installer you will be prompted to accept an End User License Agreement (EULA).

            **Note:**            &nbsp;&nbsp;Updating Surface Dock firmware requires connectivity to the Surface Dock, available only on Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, and Surface Book devices. A Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, or Surface Book is required to successfully install Microsoft Surface Dock Updater.

## Update a Surface Dock with Microsoft Surface Dock Updater


After you install the [Microsoft Surface Dock Updater](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618121) tool, you can find Microsoft Surface Dock Updater under **All Apps** in your Start menu. Click **Microsoft Surface Dock Updater** to start the application.

To update a Surface Dock with Microsoft Surface Dock Updater, follow these steps:

1.  Click Start to begin the firmware update process. If you do not have a Surface Dock connected, you will be prompted to connect a Surface Dock.

2.  Microsoft Surface Dock Updater checks the status of your Surface Dock firmware.

    -   If the tool determines that the firmware of your Surface Dock is up to date, a **You have the latest firmware for this Surface Dock** message is displayed, as shown in Figure 1.
