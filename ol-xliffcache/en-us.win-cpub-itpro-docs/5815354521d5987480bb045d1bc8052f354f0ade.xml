(To import an uncontrolled GPO, control the GPO. See [Request Control of a Previously Uncontrolled GPO](request-control-of-a-previously-uncontrolled-gpo.md).)\n\nA user account with the Editor, Approver, or AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role or necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To import a GPO from the production environment**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab, click the **Controlled** tab to display the controlled GPOs.\n\n3.  Right-click the GPO, and then click **Import from Production**.\n\n4.  Type a comment for the audit trail of the GPO, then click **OK**.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Editor, Approver, or AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and either **Edit Settings**, **Deploy GPO**, or **Delete GPO** permissions for the GPO.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Creating, Controlling, or Importing a GPO](creating-controlling-or-importing-a-gpo-editor.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
