Use the information generated during the [Designing a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy](designing-a-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-strategy.md) section of this guide to determine the zone in which to put each host. You can document this zone placement by adding a Group column to the inventory table shown in the Designing a Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Strategy section. A sample is shown here:\n\n| Host name | Hardware reqs met | Software reqs met | Configuration required | Details | Projected cost | Group |\n| - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| CLIENT001 | No| No| Upgrade hardware and software.| Current operating system is Windows XP. Old hardware not compatible with newer versions of Windows.| $??| Isolated domain| \n| SERVER002 | Yes| No| Join trusted domain, upgrade from Windows Server 2008 to at least Windows Server 2012| No antivirus software present.| $??| Encryption| \n| SENSITIVE001 | Yes| Yes| Not required.| Running Windows Server 2012.
