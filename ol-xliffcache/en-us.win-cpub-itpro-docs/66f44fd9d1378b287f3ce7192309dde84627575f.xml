Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To delegate the management of a controlled GPO**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click the **Controlled** tab to display controlled GPOs, and then click the GPO to delegate:\n\n    1.  To add access for a user or group, click the **Add** button, select the user or group, and click **OK**. In the **Add Group or User** dialog box, select a role and click **OK**.\n\n    2.  To remove access for a user or group, select the user or group, and click the **Remove** button.\n\n        **Note**  \n        If a user or group inherits domain-wide access, the **Remove** button is unavailable. You can modify domain-wide access on the **Domain Delegation** tab.\n\n         \n\n    3.  To modify the roles and permissions delegated to a user or group, click the **Advanced** button. In the **Permissions** dialog box, select the user or group, select the check box for each role to be assigned to that user or group, and click **OK**.\n\n        **Note**  \n        Editor and Approver include Reviewer permissions.\n\n         \n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be the Approver who created or controlled the GPO or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** permission for the domain and **Modify Security** permission for the GPO.\n\n-   To delegate read access to Group Policy administrators who use AGPM, you must grant them **List Contents** as well as **Read Settings** permissions. This enables them to view GPOs on the **Contents** tab of AGPM. Other permissions must be explicitly delegated.\n\n-   Editors must have **Read** permission for the deployed copy of a GPO to make full use of Group Policy Software Installation.\n\n-   Membership in the Group Policy Creator Owners group should be restricted, so it is not used to circumvent AGPM management of access to GPOs. (In the **Group Policy Management Console**, click **Group Policy Objects** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs, click **Delegation**, and then configure the settings to meet the needs of your organization.)\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Managing the Archive](managing-the-archive.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
