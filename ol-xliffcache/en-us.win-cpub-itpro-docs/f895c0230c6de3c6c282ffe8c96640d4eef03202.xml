show the usage of sensitive privileges. This is the list of sensitive privileges:\n\n-   Act as part of the operating system\n\n-   Back up files and directories\n\n-   Restore files and directories\n\n-   Create a token object\n\n-   Debug programs\n\n-   Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation\n\n-   Generate security audits\n\n-   Impersonate a client after authentication\n\n-   Load and unload device drivers\n\n-   Manage auditing and security log\n\n-   Modify firmware environment values\n\n-   Replace a process-level token\n\n-   Take ownership of files or other objects\n\nThe use of two privileges, “Back up files and directories” and “Restore files and directories,” generate events only if the “[Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj852206.aspx)” Group Policy setting is enabled on the computer or device. We do not recommend enabling this Group Policy setting because of the high number of events recorded.\n\nThis subcategory also contains informational events from the file system Transaction Manager.\n\nIf you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when sensitive privilege requests are made. Success audits record successful attempts, and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.\n\n**Event volume**: High.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | We recommend tracking Success and Failure for this subcategory of events, especially if the sensitive privileges were used by a user account. |\n| Member Server     | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | We recommend tracking Success and Failure for this subcategory of events, especially if the sensitive privileges were used by a user account. |\n| Workstation       | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | We recommend tracking Success and Failure for this subcategory of events, especially if the sensitive privileges were used by a user account. |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4673](event-4673.md)(S, F): A privileged service was called.\n\n-   [4674](event-4674.md)(S, F): An operation was attempted on a privileged object.\n\n-   [4985](event-4985.md)(S): The state of a transaction has changed.\n\n>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason event “[4985](event-4985.md)(S): The state of a transaction has changed\" from [Audit File System](audit-file-system.md) subcategory generates also in this subcategory.
