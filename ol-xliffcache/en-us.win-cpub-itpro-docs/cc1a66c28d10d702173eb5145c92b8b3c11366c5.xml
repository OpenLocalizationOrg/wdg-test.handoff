the MED-V workspace will appear in seamless integration or full desktop mode. Seamless integration includes legacy applications in the host desktop so that they appear as if they are installed directly on the host. Full desktop presents the desktop of the MED-V workspace operating system in a separate window on the host.\n\nAll general settings are configured in the **Policy** module, on the **General** tab.\n\n**To apply general settings to a MED-V workspace**\n\n1.  Click the MED-V workspace to configure.\n\n2.  Configure the general properties as described in the following table.\n\n3.  On the **Policy** menu, select **Commit**.\n\n**General Workspace Properties**\n\nProperty\nDescription\n*Workspace Properties*\n\nName\n\nThe name of the MED-V workspace.\n\n**Warning**  \nDo not rename an existing MED-V workspace while it is running on a client computer.\n\n \n\nDescription\n\nDescription of the MED-V workspace, which can include the content or status of the MED-V workspace and any other useful information.\n\n**Note**  \nThe description is for administrator use and has no impact on the policy.\n\n \n\nSupport contact info\n\nThe contact information for technical support.

In the **Frame color** field, select the color.\n\nFull Desktop\n\nSelect this option to display the MED-V workspace as the entire desktop, without integrating with the host.\n\n*Host Verification*\n\nCommand line\n\nType a command line to run on the host before starting the MED-V workspace.\n\nDo not start the Workspace if the verification fails (exit code is not '0')\n\nSelect this check box if you are using a command line and want to start the MED-V workspace only if the script is completed successfully.\n\n \n\nA command line can be run on the host prior to starting the MED-V workspace.\n\n**To run a command line before starting a MED-V workspace**\n\n1.
