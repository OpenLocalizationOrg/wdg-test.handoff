# 5066(S, F): A cryptographic function operation was attempted.

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


This event generates in [BCryptAddContextFunction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa375360(v=vs.85).aspx)() and [BCryptRemoveContextFunction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa375492(v=vs.85).aspx)() functions. These are Cryptographic Next Generation (CNG) functions.

This event generates when cryptographic function was added or removed from the list of functions that are supported by an existing CNG context.
