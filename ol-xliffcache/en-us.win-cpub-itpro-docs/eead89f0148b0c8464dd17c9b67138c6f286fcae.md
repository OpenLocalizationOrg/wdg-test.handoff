You can monitor the success of the activation process for a computer running Windows 8.1 in several ways. The most popular methods include:
-   Using the Volume Licensing Service Center website to track use of MAK keys.
-   Using the **Slmgr /dlv** command on a client computer or on the KMS host. (For a full list of options, see [Slmgr.vbs Options](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff793433.aspx).)
-   Viewing the licensing status, which is exposed through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI); therefore, it is available to non-Microsoft or custom tools that can access WMI. (Windows PowerShell can also access WMI information.)
-   Most licensing actions and events are recorded in the Event log.
-   Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and the KMS Management Pack can provide insight and information to users of System Center Operations Manager.
-   The VAMT provides a single site from which to manage and monitor volume activations. This is explained in the next section.
