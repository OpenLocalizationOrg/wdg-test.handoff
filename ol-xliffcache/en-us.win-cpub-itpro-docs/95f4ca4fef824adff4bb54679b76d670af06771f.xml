This enables you to define computer system access control lists (SACLs) per object type for the file system. The specified SACL is then automatically applied to every file system object type.\n\nIf both a file or folder SACL and a global SACL are configured on a computer, the effective SACL is derived by combining the file or folder SACL and the global SACL. This means that an audit event is generated if an activity matches either the file or folder SACL or the global SACL.\nThis policy setting must be used in combination with the **File System** security policy setting under Object Access. For more information, see [Audit File System](audit-file-system.md).\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Advanced security audit policy settings](advanced-security-audit-policy-settings.md)\n"}
