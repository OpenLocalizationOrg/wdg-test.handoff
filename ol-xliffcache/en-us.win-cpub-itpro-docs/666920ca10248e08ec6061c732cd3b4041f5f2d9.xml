Although we do not recommend it, you can also rebuild and redeploy the MED-V workspace with the updated URL redirection information.\n\nThe registry key is usually located at:\n\nComputer\\\\HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\MEDV\\\\v2\\\\UserExperience\n\nThe following multi-string value must be present: `RedirectUrls`\n\nThe value data for `RedirectUrls` is a list of all of the URLs that you specified for redirection when you built the MED-V workspace package by using the **MED-V Workspace Packager**. For more information, see [Create a MED-V Workspace Package](create-a-med-v-workspace-package.md).\n\nYou can add and remove URL redirection information by performing one of the following tasks:\n\n-   [Edit the URL Redirection Registry Key and Deploy Using Group Policy](#bkmk-editreg)\n\n-   [Edit the URL Redirection Text File and Rebuild the MED-V Workspace](#bkmk-edittext)\n\n**To update URL Redirection information by using Group Policy**\n\n1.  Edit the registry key multi-string value that is named `RedirectUrls`. This value is typically located at:\n\n    Computer\\\\HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\MEDV\\\\v2\\\\UserExperience\n\n    If you are adding URLs to the registry key, enter them one per line, as was required when you built the MED-V workspace package. For more information, see [Create a MED-V Workspace Package](create-a-med-v-workspace-package.md).\n\n2.  Deploy the updated registry key by using Group Policy. For more information about how to use Group Policy, see [Group Policy Software Installation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=195931) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=195931).\n\n**Note**  \nThis method of editing URL redirection information is a MED-V best practice.\n\n \n\n**To rebuild the MED-V workspace by using an updated URL text file**\n\n-   Another method of adding and removing URLs from the redirection list is to update the URL redirection text file and then use it to build a new MED-V workspace. You can then redeploy the MED-V workspace as before, by using your standard process of deployment, such as an ESD system.\n\n    **Important**  \n    We do not recommend this method of editing URL redirection information. In addition, any time that you redeploy the MED-V workspace back out to your enterprise, first time setup must run again, and any data saved in the virtual machine is lost.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Test URL Redirection](how-to-test-url-redirection.md)\n\n[Managing Applications Deployed to MED-V Workspaces](managing-applications-deployed-to-med-v-workspaces.md)\n\n[Create a MED-V Workspace Package](create-a-med-v-workspace-package.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
