# Enhanced Protected Mode problems with Internet Explorer
Enhanced Protected Mode further restricts Protected Mode to deny potential attackers access to sensitive or personal information. If this feature is turned on, users might start to see errors asking them to turn it off, like **This webpage wants to run "npctrl.dll. If you trust this site, you can disable Enhanced Protected Mode for this site to run the control**. If your users click the **Disable** box, Enhanced Protected Mode is turned off for only the single visit to that specific site. After the user leaves the site, Enhanced Protected Mode is automatically turned back on.

You can use your companyâ€™s Group Policy to turn Enhanced Protected Mode on or off for all users. For more information, see the [Group policy objects and Internet Explorer 11 (IE11)](group-policy-objects-and-ie11.md) information in this guide.

For more information about Enhanced Protected Mode, see the [Enhanced Protected Mode](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=267512) post on IEBlog, and both the [Understanding Enhanced Protected Mode](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=282662) and the [Enhanced Protected Mode and Local Files](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=282663) blog posts on IEInternals.
