of MBAM 2.5 with Stand-alone Topology\n\n\nThis topic describes the recommended architecture for deploying Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) with the Configuration Manager Stand-alone topology. In this topology, MBAM is deployed as a stand-alone product. You can alternatively deploy MBAM with the Configuration Manager Integration topology, which integrates MBAM with Configuration Manager. For more information, see [High-Level Architecture of MBAM 2.5 with Configuration Manager Integration Topology](high-level-architecture-of-mbam-25-with-configuration-manager-integration-topology.md).\n\nFor a list of the supported versions of the software mentioned in this topic, see [MBAM 2.5 Supported Configurations](mbam-25-supported-configurations.md).\n\n**Note**  \nWe recommend you use a single-server architecture in test environments only.\n\n \n\n## Recommended number of servers and supported number of clients\n\n\nThe recommended number of servers and supported number of clients in a production environment is as follows:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Recommended architecture in a production environment</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Number of servers and other computers</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Two servers</p>\n<p>One workstation</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Number of client computers supported</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>500,000</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Recommended MBAM high-level architecture with the Stand-alone topology\n\n\nThe following diagram and table describe the recommended high-level, two-server architecture for MBAM with the Stand-alone topology. MBAM multi-forest deployments require a one-way or two-way trust. One-way trusts require that the server domain trusts the client domain.\n\n![mbam2](images/mbam2-5-2servers.png)\n\nServer\nFeatures to configure on this server\nDescription\nDatabase server\n\nCompliance and Audit Database\n\nThis feature is configured on a server running Windows Server and supported SQL Server instance.\n\nThe **Compliance and Audit Database** stores compliance data, which is used primarily for reports that SQL Server Reporting Services hosts.\n\nRecovery Database\n\nThis feature is configured on a server running Windows Server and supported SQL Server instance.\n\nThe **Recovery Database** stores recovery data that is collected from MBAM client computers.\n\nReports\n\nThis feature is configured on a server running Windows Server and supported SQL Server instance.\n\nThe **Reports** provide recovery audit and compliance status data about the client computers in your enterprise.
