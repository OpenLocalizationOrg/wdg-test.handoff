contains a brief overview of accounts and groups, log files, and other security-related considerations for Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) 2.0, 2.1, and 2.1 SP1. For more information, follow the links that are provided here.\n\n## Security considerations for UE-V configuration\n\n\n**Important**  \nWhen you create the settings storage share, limit the share access to users who require access.\n\n \n\nBecause settings packages might contain personal information, you should take care to protect them as well as possible. In general, do the following:\n\n-   Restrict the share to only those users who require access. Create a security group for users who have redirected folders on a particular share and limit access to only those users.\n\n-   When you create the share, hide the share by putting a $ after the share name. This addition hides the share from casual browsers, and the share is not visible in My Network Places.\n\n-   Only give users the minimum amount of permissions that they must have. The following tables show the required permissions.\n\n    1.  Set the following share-level SMB permissions for the setting storage location folder.\n\n        <table>\n        <colgroup>\n        <col width=\"50%\" />\n        <col width=\"50%\" />\n        </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n        <tr class=\"header\">\n        <th align=\"left\">User account</th>\n        <th align=\"left\">Recommended permissions</th>\n        </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Everyone</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>No permissions</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Security group of UE-V</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Full control</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody>\n        </table>\n\n         \n\n    2.  Set the following NTFS file system permissions for the settings storage location folder.\n\n        <table>\n        <colgroup>\n        <col width=\"33%\" />\n        <col width=\"33%\" />\n        <col width=\"33%\" />\n        </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n        <tr class=\"header\">\n        <th align=\"left\">User account</th>\n        <th align=\"left\">Recommended permissions</th>\n        <th align=\"left\">Folder</th>\n        </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Creator/Owner</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>No permissions</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>No permissions</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Domain Admins</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Full control</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>This folder, subfolders, and files</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Security group of UE-V users</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>List folder/read data, create folders/append data</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>This folder only</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Everyone</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Remove all permissions</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>No permissions</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody>\n        </table>\n\n         \n\n    3.

Because of this process, you should ensure that the data is protected while it travels over the network.\n\nUser settings data is vulnerable to these potential threats: interception of the data as it passes over the network, tampering with the data as it passes over the network, and spoofing of the server that hosts the data.\n\nAs of Windows Server 2003, several features of the Windows Server operating system can help secure user data:\n\n-   **Kerberos** - Kerberos is standard on all versions of Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server beginning with Windows Server 2003. Kerberos ensures the highest level of security to network resources. NTLM authenticates the client only; Kerberos authenticates the server and the client. When NTLM is used, the client does not know whether the server is valid. This difference is particularly important if the client exchanges personal files with the server, as is the case with Roaming User Profiles. Kerberos provides better security than NTLM. Kerberos is not available on the Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or earlier operating systems.\n\n-   **IPsec** - The IP Security Protocol (IPsec) provides network-level authentication, data integrity, and encryption. IPsec ensures the following:\n\n    -   Roamed data is safe from data modification while data is en route.\n\n    -   Roamed data is safe from interception, viewing, or copying.\n\n    -   Roamed data is safe from access by unauthenticated parties.\n\n-   **SMB Signing** - The Server Message Block (SMB) authentication protocol supports message authentication, which prevents active message and \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB. The digital signature is then verified by both the client and the server. In order to use SMB signing, you must first either enable it, or you must require it on both the SMB client and the SMB server. Note that the SMB signing imposes a performance penalty. It does not consume any more network bandwidth, but it uses more CPU cycles on the client and server side.\n\n### Always use the NTFS file system for volumes that hold user data\n\nFor the most secure configuration, configure servers that host the UE-V settings files to use the NTFS file system. Unlike the FAT file system, NTFS supports Discretionary access control lists (DACLs) and system access control lists (SACLs). DACLs and SACLs control who can perform operations on a file and what events trigger the logging of actions that is performed on a file.\n\n### Do not rely on EFS to encrypt user files when they are transmitted over the network\n\nWhen you use the Encrypting File System (EFS) to encrypt files on a remote server, the encrypted data is not encrypted during transit over the network; it only becomes encrypted when it is stored on disk.\n\nThis encryption process does not apply when your system includes Internet Protocol security (IPsec) or Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV). IPsec encrypts data while it is transported over a TCP/IP network. If the file is encrypted before it is copied or moved to a WebDAV folder on a server, it remains encrypted during the transmission and while it is stored on the server.\n\n### Let the UE-V Agent create folders for each user\n\nTo ensure that UE-V works optimally, create only the root share on the server, and let the UE-V Agent create the folders for each user. UE-V creates these user folders with the appropriate security.\n\nThis permission configuration enables users to create folders for settings storage. The UE-V Agent creates and secures a settings package folder while it runs in the context of the user. Users receive full control to their settings package folder. Other users do not inherit access to this folder. You do not have to create and secure individual user directories. The agent that runs in the context of the user does it automatically.\n\n**Note**  \nAdditional security can be configured when a Windows Server is used for the settings storage share. UE-V can be configured to verify that either the local Administrators group or the current user is the owner of the folder where settings packages are stored. To enable additional security, use the following command:\n\n1.  Add the REG\\_DWORD registry key RepositoryOwnerCheckEnabled to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\UEV\\Agent\\Configuration`.\n\n2.  Set the registry key value to *1*.\n\nWhen this configuration setting is in place, the UE-V Agent verifies that the local Administrators group or current user is the owner of the settings package folder. If not, then the UE-V Agent does not grant access to the folder.\n\n \n\nIf you must create folders for the users, ensure that you have the correct permissions set.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you do not pre-create folders. Instead, let the UE-V Agent create the folder for the user.\n\n### Ensure correct permissions to store UE-V 2 settings in a home directory or custom directory\n\nIf you redirect UE-V settings to a user’s home directory or a custom Active Directory (AD) directory, ensure that the permissions on the directory are set appropriately for your organization.\n\n## Got a suggestion for UE-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://uev.uservoice.com/forums/280428-microsoft-user-experience-virtualization).
