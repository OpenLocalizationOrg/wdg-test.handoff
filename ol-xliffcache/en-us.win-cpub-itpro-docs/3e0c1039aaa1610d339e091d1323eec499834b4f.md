# Troubleshoot Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14332 or later
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

<span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>

This section addresses issues that might arise as you use the Windows Defender Advanced Threat service.

### Server error - Access is denied due to invalid credentials
If you encounter a server error when trying to access the service, youâ€™ll need to change your browser cookie settings.
Configure your browser to allow cookies.

### No data is shown on the portal
If no data is displayed on the Dashboard portal even if no errors were encountered in the portal logs or in the browser console, you'll need to whitelist the threat intelligence, data access, and detonation endpoints that also use this protocol.

Depending on your region, add the following endpoints to the whitelist:

U.S. region:

- daasmon-cus-prd.cloudapp.net          
- daasmon-eus-prd.cloudapp.net          
- dataaccess-cus-prd.cloudapp.net           
- dataaccess-eus-prd.cloudapp.net           
- onboardingservice-prd.trafficmanager.net          
- sevillefeedback-prd.trafficmanager.net            
- sevillesettings-prd.trafficmanager.net            
- threatintel-cus-prd.cloudapp.net          
- threatintel-eus-prd.cloudapp.net          



EU region:

- dataaccess-neu-prd.cloudapp.net
- dataaccess-weu-prd.cloudapp.net
- onboardingservice-prd.trafficmanager.net
- sevillefeedback-prd.trafficmanager.net
- sevillesettings-prd.trafficmanager.net
- threatintel-neu-prd.cloudapp.net
- threatintel-weu-prd.cloudapp.net
