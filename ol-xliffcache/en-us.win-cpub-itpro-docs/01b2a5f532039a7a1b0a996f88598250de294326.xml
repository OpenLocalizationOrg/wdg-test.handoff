To open the **MED-V Workspace Packager**, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization**, and then click **MED-V Workspace Packager**.\n\n2.  On the **MED-V Workspace Packager** main panel, click **Manage Web Redirection**.\n\n3.  In the **Manage Web Redirection** window, you can type, paste, or import a list of the URLs that are redirected to Internet Explorer in the MED-V workspace.\n\n    **Note**  \n    URL redirection in MED-V only supports the protocols HTTP and HTTPS. MED-V does not provide support for FTP or any other protocols.\n\n     \n\n    Enter each web address on a single line, for example:\n\n    http://www.contoso.com/webapps/webapp1\n\n    http://www.contoso.com/webapps/webapp2\n\n    http://\\*.contoso.com\n\n    http://www.contoso.com/webapps/\\*\n\n    **Important**  \n    If you import a text file that includes a URL that uses special characters (such as ~ ! @ \\# and so on), make sure that you specify UTF-8 encoding when you save the text file. Special characters do not import correctly into the MED-V Workspace Packager if the text file was saved using the default ANSI encoding.\n\n     \n\n4.  Click **Save as…** to save the updated URL redirection files in the specified folder. MED-V creates a registry file that contains the updated URL redirection information. Deploy the updated registry key by using Group Policy. For more information about how to use Group Policy, see [Group Policy Software Installation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=195931) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=195931).\n\n    MED-V also creates a Windows PowerShell script in the specified folder that you can use to re-create the updated MED-V workspace package.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Add or Remove URL Redirection Information in a Deployed MED-V Workspace](how-to-add-or-remove-url-redirection-information-in-a-deployed-med-v-workspace.md)\n\n[Manage MED-V URL Redirection](manage-med-v-url-redirection.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
