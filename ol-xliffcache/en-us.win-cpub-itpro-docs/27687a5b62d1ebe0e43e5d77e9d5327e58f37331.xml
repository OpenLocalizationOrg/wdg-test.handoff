Applying new configuration for this setting will not take effect until the App-V 5.0 service is restarted.\n\nWORKAROUND: Restart the App-V 5.0 service.\n\n## Release Notes Copyright Information\n\n\nMicrosoft, Active Directory, ActiveX, Bing, Excel, Silverlight, SQL Server, Windows, Microsoft Intune, and Windows PowerShell are trademarks of the Microsoft group of companies.
