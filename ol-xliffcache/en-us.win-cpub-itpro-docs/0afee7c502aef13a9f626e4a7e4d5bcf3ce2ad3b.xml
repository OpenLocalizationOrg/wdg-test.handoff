Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To request the deployment of a GPO to the production environment of the domain**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab, click the **Controlled** tab to display the controlled GPOs.\n\n3.  Right-click the GPO to be deployed, and then click **Deploy**.\n\n4.  Unless you are an Approver or AGPM Administrator or have special permission to deploy GPOs, you must submit a request for deployment. To receive a copy of the request, type your e-mail address in the **Cc** field. Type a comment to be displayed in the **History** for the GPO, and then click **Submit**.\n\n5.  When the **Progress** window indicates that overall progress is complete, click **Close**. The GPO is displayed on the list of GPOs on the **Pending** tab. When an Approver has approved your request, the GPO will be moved from the **Pending** tab to the **Controlled** tab and be deployed.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Editor to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Edit Settings** permissions for the GPO.\n\n-   To withdraw your request before it has been approved, click the **Pending** tab. Right-click the GPO, and then click **Withdraw**. The GPO will be returned to the **Controlled** tab.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Performing Editor Tasks](performing-editor-tasks-agpm40.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
