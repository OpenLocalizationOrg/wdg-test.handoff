either Windows Internet Explorer 8 or Windows Internet Explorer 7, avoiding the common compatibility problems associated with web apps written and tested on older versions of Internet Explorer.\n\nYou can use IE11 and the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager to add individual website domains and domain paths and to specify whether the site renders using Enterprise Mode or the default mode.\n\n## Enterprise Mode Site List Manager versions\nThere are currently two versions of the Enterprise Site List Manager, both based on your schema and operating system. Download the [Enterprise Mode Site List Manager (schema v.2)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=716853) or the [Enterprise Mode Site List Manager (schema v.1)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=394378) tool, based on your operating system.\n\n|Operating system |Schema version |Enterprise Site List Manager version |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------------|\n|Windows 10 |Enterprise Mode schema, version 2 (v.2)<p>-OR-<p>Enterprise Mode schema, version 1 (v.1) |Windows 10 supports both versions of the enterprise mode schema.
