## Configure sample collection settings with Group Policy
1.  On your GP management machine, copy the following files from the configuration package:

    a.  Copy _AtpConfiguration.admx_ into _C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions_

    b.  Copy _AtpConfiguration.adml_ into _C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions\\en-US_

2.  Open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the GPO you want to configure and click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor**, go to **Computer configuration**.

4.  Click **Policies**, then **Administrative templates**.

5.  Click **Windows components** and then **Windows Advanced Threat Protection**.

6.  Choose to enable or disable sample sharing from your endpoints.
