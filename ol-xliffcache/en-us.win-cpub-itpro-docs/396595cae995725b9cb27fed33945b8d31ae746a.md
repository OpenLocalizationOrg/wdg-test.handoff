# Device reset (Surface Hub)


You may wish to reset your Microsoft Surface Hub.

Typical reasons for a reset include:

-   The device isn’t running well after installing an update.
-   You’re repurposing the device for a new meeting space and want to reconfigure it.
-   You want to change how you locally manage the device.

Initiating a reset will return the device to the last cumulative Windows update, and remove all local user files and configuration, including:

-   The device account
-   MDM enrollment
-   Domain join or Azure AD join information
-   Local admins on the device
-   Configurations from MDM or the Settings app

**Important Note**</br>
Performing a device reset may take up to 6 hours. Do not interrupt the reset process. Interrupting the process will render the device inoperable, requiring warranty service to return to normal functionality.

After the reset, you'll be taken through the [first run program](first-run-program-surface-hub.md) again.
