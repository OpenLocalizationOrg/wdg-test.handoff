audit events for other logon or logoff events.\n\nThese other logon or logoff events include:\n\n-   A Remote Desktop session connects or disconnects.\n\n-   A workstation is locked or unlocked.\n\n-   A screen saver is invoked or dismissed.\n\n-   A replay attack is detected. This event indicates that a Kerberos request was received twice with identical information. This condition could also be caused by network misconfiguration.\n\n-   A user is granted access to a wireless network. It can be either a user account or the computer account.\n\n-   A user is granted access to a wired 802.1x network. It can be either a user account or the computer account.\n\nLogon events are essential to understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.\n\n**Event volume**: Low.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | We recommend Success auditing, to track possible Kerberos replay attacks, terminal session connect and disconnect actions, network authentication events, and some other events.
