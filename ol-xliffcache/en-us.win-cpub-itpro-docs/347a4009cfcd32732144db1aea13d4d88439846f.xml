Windows To Go workspaces can use the same image enterprises use for their desktops and laptops and can be managed the same way. Windows To Go is not intended to replace desktops, laptops or supplant other mobility offerings. Rather, it provides support for efficient use of resources for alternative workplace scenarios. There are some additional considerations that you should keep in mind before you start to use Windows To Go:\n\n-   [Differences between Windows To Go and a typical installation of Windows](#bkmk-wtgdif)\n\n-   [Roaming with Windows To Go](#bkmk-wtgroam)\n\n-   [Prepare for Windows To Go](#wtg-prep-intro)\n\n-   [Hardware considerations for Windows To Go](#wtg-hardware)\n\n**Note**  \nWindows To Go is not supported on Windows RT.\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-wtgdif\"></a>Differences between Windows To Go and a typical installation of Windows\n\n\nWindows To Go workspace operates just like any other installation of Windows with a few exceptions. These exceptions are:\n\n-   **Internal disks are offline.** To ensure data isn’t accidentally disclosed, internal hard disks on the host computer are offline by default when booted into a Windows To Go workspace. Similarly if a Windows To Go drive is inserted into a running system, the Windows To Go drive will not be listed in Windows Explorer.\n\n-   **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is not used.** When using BitLocker Drive Encryption a pre-operating system boot password will be used for security rather than the TPM since the TPM is tied to a specific computer and Windows To Go drives will move between computers.\n\n-   **Hibernate is disabled by default.** To ensure that the Windows To Go workspace is able to move between computers easily, hibernation is disabled by default. Hibernation can be re-enabled by using Group Policy settings.\n\n-   **Windows Recovery Environment is not available.** In the rare case that you need to recover your Windows To Go drive, you should re-image it with a fresh image of Windows.\n\n-   **Refreshing or resetting a Windows To Go workspace is not supported.** Resetting to the manufacturer’s standard for the computer doesn’t apply when running a Windows To Go workspace, so the feature was disabled.\n\n-   **Upgrading a Windows To Go workspace is not supported.** Older Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 Windows To Go workspaces cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 workspaces, nor can Windows 10 Windows To Go workspaces be upgraded to future versions of Windows 10. For new versions, the workspace needs to be re-imaged with a fresh image of Windows.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-wtgroam\"></a>Roaming with Windows To Go\n\n\nWindows To Go drives can be booted on multiple computers. When a Windows To Go workspace is first booted on a host computer it will detect all hardware on the computer and install any needed drivers. When the Windows To Go workspace is subsequently booted on that host computer it will be able to identify the host computer and load the correct set of drivers automatically.\n\nThe applications that you want to use from the Windows To Go workspace should be tested to make sure they also support roaming. Some applications bind to the computer hardware which will cause difficulties if the workspace is being used with multiple host computers.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"wtg-prep-intro\"></a>Prepare for Windows To Go\n\n\nEnterprises install Windows on a large group of computers either by using configuration management software (such as System Center Configuration Manager), or by using standard Windows deployment tools such as DiskPart and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.\n\nThese same tools can be used to provision Windows To Go drive, just as you would if you were planning for provisioning a new class of mobile PCs. You can use the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526803) to review deployment tools available.\n\n**Important**  \nMake sure you use the versions of the deployment tools provided for the version of Windows you are deploying. There have been many enhancements made to support Windows To Go. Using versions of the deployment tools released for earlier versions of Windows to provision a Windows To Go drive is not supported.\n\n \n\nAs you decide what to include in your Windows To Go image, be sure to consider the following questions:\n\nAre there any drivers that you need to inject into the image?\n\nHow will data be stored and synchronized to appropriate locations from the USB device?\n\nAre there any applications that are incompatible with Windows To Go roaming that should not be included in the image?\n\nWhat should be the architecture of the image - 32bit/64bit?\n\nWhat remote connectivity solution should be supported in the image if Windows To Go is used outside the corporate network?\n\nFor more information about designing and planning your Windows To Go deployment, see [Prepare your organization for Windows To Go](prepare-your-organization-for-windows-to-go.md).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"wtg-hardware\"></a>Hardware considerations for Windows To Go\n\n\n**For USB drives**\n\nThe devices listed in this section have been specially optimized and certified for Windows To Go and meet the necessary requirements for booting and running a full version of Windows 10 from a USB drive.
