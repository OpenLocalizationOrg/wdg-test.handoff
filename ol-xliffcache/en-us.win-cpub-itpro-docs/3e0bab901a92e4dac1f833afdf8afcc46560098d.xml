Like an AGPM Administrator (Full Control), the Approver can delegate access to such a GPO, so selected Editors can edit it, Reviewers can review it, and other Approvers can approve it. By default, an Approver cannot delegate access to GPOs created by another Group Policy administrator.\n\nA user account with the AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role, the user account of the Approver who created the GPO, or a user account with the necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To delegate the management of a controlled GPO**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click the **Controlled** tab to display controlled GPOs, and then click the GPO to delegate.\n\n3.  Click the **Add** button, select the users or groups to be permitted access, and then click **OK**.\n\n4.  To customize the permissions for each, click the **Advanced** button on the **Contents** tab and check role permissions to allow or deny. (For more detailed control, click **Advanced** in the **Permissions** dialog box.)\n\n5.  Click **Apply**, and then click **OK** in the **Permissions** dialog box.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be the Approver who created or controlled the GPO or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** permission for the domain and **Modify Security** permission for the GPO.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Creating, Controlling, or Importing a GPO](creating-controlling-or-importing-a-gpo-approver.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
