Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit User Account Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific user account management tasks are

Events include the following:\n\n-   A user account is created, changed, deleted, renamed, disabled, enabled, locked out or unlocked.\n\n-   A user account’s password is set or changed.\n\n-   A security identifier (SID) is added to the SID History of a user account, or fails to be added.\n\n-   The Directory Services Restore Mode password is configured.\n\n-   Permissions on administrative user accounts are changed.\n\n-   A user's local group membership was enumerated.\n\n-   Credential Manager credentials are backed up or restored.\n\nSome events in this subcategory, for example 4722, 4725, 4724, and 4781, are also generated for computer accounts.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | This subcategory contains many useful events for monitoring, especially for critical domain accounts, such as domain admins, service accounts, database admins, and so on.<br>We recommend Failure auditing, mostly to see invalid password change and reset attempts for domain accounts, DSRM account password change failures, and failed SID History add attempts. |\n| Member Server     | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | We recommend monitoring all changes related to local user accounts, especially built-in local Administrator and other critical accounts.<br>We recommend Failure auditing, mostly to see invalid password change and reset attempts for local accounts.                                                                                                                |\n| Workstation       | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | We recommend monitoring all changes related to local user accounts, especially built-in local Administrator and other critical accounts.<br>We recommend Failure auditing, mostly to see invalid password change and reset attempts for local accounts.                                                                                                                |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4720](event-4720.md)(S): A user account was created.\n\n-   [4722](event-4722.md)(S): A user account was enabled.\n\n-   [4723](event-4723.md)(S, F): An attempt was made to change an account's password.\n\n-   [4724](event-4724.md)(S, F): An attempt was made to reset an account's password.\n\n-   [4725](event-4725.md)(S): A user account was disabled.\n\n-   [4726](event-4726.md)(S): A user account was deleted.\n\n-   [4738](event-4738.md)(S): A user account was changed.\n\n-   [4740](event-4740.md)(S): A user account was locked out.\n\n-   [4765](event-4765.md)(S): SID History was added to an account.\n\n-   [4766](event-4766.md)(F): An attempt to add SID History to an account failed.\n\n-   [4767](event-4767.md)(S): A user account was unlocked.\n\n-   [4780](event-4780.md)(S): The ACL was set on accounts which are members of administrators groups.\n\n-   [4781](event-4781.md)(S): The name of an account was changed.\n\n-   [4794](event-4794.md)(S, F): An attempt was made to set the Directory Services Restore Mode administrator password.\n\n-   [4798](event-4798.md)(S): A user's local group membership was enumerated.\n\n-   [5376](event-5376.md)(S): Credential Manager credentials were backed up.\n\n-   [5377](event-5377.md)(S): Credential Manager credentials were restored from a backup.\n\n"}
