The import search path is used by the client to find the SFT file when you use the console to import an SFT file. If it can find the file in this search path, it will not need to prompt you for a path.\n\n**To change the import search path**\n\n1.  Right-click the **Application Virtualization** node, and select **Properties** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  On the **Import Search Path** tab in the **Properties** dialog box, click **Add** to display a standard **Browse** dialog box and browse to the desired location.\n\n3.  Highlight a path, and click **Remove** to delete this path.\n\n4.  Use the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to control the order in which the paths will be searched.\n\n5.  Click **OK** or **Apply** to change the setting.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Configure the Client in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console](how-to-configure-the-client-in-the-application-virtualization-client-management-console.md)\n\n[How to Import an Application](how-to-import-an-application.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
