The MED-V workspace is created and customized by the administrator. It consists of an image and the policy, which defines the rules and functionality of the MED-V workspace. Multiple MED-V workspaces can be created, each customized with its own configuration, settings, and rules. A user, group, or multiple users or groups can be associated with each MED-V workspace, thereby making the MED-V workspace available only for the associated user's or group's computers.\n\n## How to Add a MED-V Workspace\n\n\n**To add a MED-V workspace**\n\n1.  Click the **Policy** management button to open the **Policy** module.\n\n    The **Policy** module consists of the **Workspaces** menu on the left and the **General**, **Virtual Machine**, **Deployment**, **Applications**, **Web**, **VM Setup**, **Network**, and **Performance** tabs.\n\n2.  On the **Policy** menu, select **New Workspace**, or click **Add** to create a new MED-V workspace.\n\n3.  On the **General** tab, in the **Name** field, enter the name of the MED-V workspace.\n\n4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description for the MED-V workspace.\n\n5.  In the **Support contact info** field, enter the contact information for technical support.\n\n    For more information about configuring a MED-V workspace, see [Configuring MED-V Workspace Policies](configuring-med-v-workspace-policies.md).\n\n## How to Clone a MED-V Workspace\n\n\nA MED-V workspace can be cloned so that you can create a MED-V workspace identical to an existing MED-V workspace.\n\n**To clone a MED-V workspace**\n\n1.  Click the MED-V workspace to clone.\n\n2.  On the **Policy** menu, select **Clone Workspace**.\n\n    A new MED-V workspace is created with the name &lt;Original MED-V workspace name&gt; - 2.\n\n## How to Delete a MED-V Workspace\n\n\n**To delete a MED-V workspace**\n\n-   In the **Policy** module, while the workspace pane is in focus, click **Remove**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Using the MED-V Management Console User Interface](using-the-med-v-management-console-user-interface.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
