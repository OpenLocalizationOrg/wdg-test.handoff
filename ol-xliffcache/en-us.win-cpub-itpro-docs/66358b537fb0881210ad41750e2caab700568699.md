## User Ratings and ACT Community Ratings


Ratings are displayed graphically in the **User Ratings** column and the **Community Assessment** column. The rating color and bar count depend on how the users or community rated the item. There are three possible ratings:

-   
            **Works**. Applications with this rating receive five green bars.

-   
            **Works with minor issues or has solutions**. Applications with this rating receive three light-green bars.

-   
            **Does not work**. Applications with this rating receive a single red bar.

The color gradient from one to five bars shows the average rating.
