There are four supported methods that you can use to deploy the DaRT recovery image. To review the advantages and disadvantages of each method, see [Planning How to Save and Deploy the DaRT 8.0 Recovery Image](planning-how-to-save-and-deploy-the-dart-80-recovery-image-dart-8.md).\n\nBurn the ISO image file to a CD or DVD by using the DaRT Recovery Image wizard\n\nSave the contents of the ISO image file to a USB Flash Drive (UFD) by using the DaRT Recovery Image wizard\n\nExtract the boot.wim file from the ISO image and deploy as a remote partition that is available to end-user computers\n\nExtract the boot.wim file from the ISO image and deploy in the recovery partition of a new Windows 8 installation\n\n**Important**  \nThe **DaRT Recovery Image Wizard** provides the option to burn the image to a CD, DVD or UFD, but the other methods of saving and deploying the recovery image require additional steps that involve tools that are not included in DaRT.
