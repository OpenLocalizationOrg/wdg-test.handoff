library\nms.prod: w10\n---\n\n\n# Validating the MBAM 2.5 Server Feature Configuration\n\n\nWhen you finish the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 Server feature deployment, we recommend that you validate the deployment to ensure that all features have been successfully configured. Use the procedure that matches the topology (Stand-alone or System Center Configuration Manager Integration) that you deployed.\n\n## Validating the MBAM Server deployment with the Stand-alone topology\n\n\nUse the following steps to validate your MBAM Server deployment with the Stand-alone topology.\n\n**To validate a Stand-alone MBAM Server deployment**\n\n1.  On each server where an MBAM feature is deployed, click **Control Panel** &gt; **Programs** &gt; **Programs and Features**. Verify that **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** appears in the **Programs and Features** list.\n\n    **Note**  \n    To do the validation, you must use a domain account that has local computer administrative credentials on each server.\n\n     \n\n2.  On the server where the Recovery Database is configured, open SQL Server Management Studio and verify that the **MBAM Recovery and Hardware** database is configured.\n\n3.  On the server where the Compliance and Audit Database is configured, open SQL Server Management Studio and verify that the **MBAM Compliance Status Database** is configured.\n\n4.  On the server where the Reports feature is configured, open a web browser with administrative credentials and browse to the \"Home\" of the SQL Server Reporting Services site.\n\n    The default Home location of a SQL Server Reporting Services site instance is at:\n\n    http(s)://&lt; *MBAMReportsServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/Reports.aspx\n\n    To find the actual URL, use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager tool and select the instances that you specified during setup.\n\n5.  Confirm that a reports folder named **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** contains a data source called **MaltaDataSource** as well as the language folders. The data source contains folders with names that represent languages (for example, en-us). The reports are in the language folders.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) was configured as a named instance, the URL should resemble the following: http(s)://&lt; *MBAMReportsServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/Reports\\_&lt;*SSRSInstanceName*&gt;\n\n     \n\n    **Note**  \n    If SSRS was not configured to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL), the URL for the reports will be set to HTTP instead of HTTPS when you install the MBAM Server. If you then go to the Administration and Monitoring Website (also known as Help Desk) and select a report, the following message appears: \"Only Secure Content is Displayed.\" To show the report, click **Show All Content**.\n\n     \n\n6.  On the server where the Administration and Monitoring Website feature is configured, run **Server Manager**, browse to **Roles**, and then select **Web Server (IIS)** &gt; **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.\n\n7.  In **Connections**, browse to *&lt;computer name&gt;* and select **Sites** &gt; **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring**. Verify that the following are listed:\n\n    -   **MBAMAdministrationService**\n\n    -   **MBAMComplianceStatusService**\n\n    -   **MBAMRecoveryAndHardwareService**\n\n8.  On the server where the Administration and Monitoring Website and Self-Service Portal are configured, open a web browser with administrative credentials.\n\n9.  Browse to the following websites to verify that they load successfully:\n\n    -   https(s)://&lt;*MBAMAdministrationServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/HelpDesk/ - confirm each of the links for navigation and reports\n\n    -   http(s)://&lt; *MBAMAdministrationServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/SelfService/\n\n    **Note**  \n    It is assumed that you configured the server features on the default port without network encryption. If you configured the server features on a different port or virtual directory, change the URLs to include the appropriate port, for example:\n\n    http(s)://&lt; *host name*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/HelpDesk/\n\n    http(s)://&lt; *host name*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/&lt;*virtualdirectory*&gt;/\n\n    If the server features were configured with network encryption, change http:// to https://.\n\n     \n\n10. Browse to the following web services to verify that they load successfully. A page opens to indicate that the service is running, but the page does not display any metadata.\n\n    -   http(s)://&lt; *MBAMAdministrationServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/MBAMAdministrationService/AdministrationService.svc\n\n    -   http(s)://&lt; *MBAMAdministrationServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/MBAMUserSupportService/UserSupportService.svc\n\n    -   http(s)://&lt; *MBAMAdministrationServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/MBAMComplianceStatusService/StatusReportingService.svc\n\n    -   http(s)://&lt; *MBAMAdministrationServerName*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/MBAMRecoveryAndHardwareService/CoreService.svc\n\n## Validating the MBAM Server deployment with the Configuration Manager Integration topology\n\n\nUse the following steps to validate your MBAM deployment with the Configuration Manager Integration topology. Complete the validation steps that match the version of Configuration Manager that you are using.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"validating-the-mbam-server-deployment-with-system-center-2012-configuration-manager-\"></a>Validating the MBAM Server deployment with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager\n\nUse these steps to validate your MBAM Server deployment when you are using MBAM with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager.\n\n**To validate a Configuration Manager Integration MBAM Server deployment – System Center 2012 Configuration Manager**\n\n1.  On the server where System Center 2012 Configuration Manager is deployed, open **Programs and Features** in **Control Panel**, and verify that **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** appears.\n\n    **Note**  \n    To validate the configuration, you must use a domain account that has local computer administrative credentials on each server.\n\n     \n\n2.  In the Configuration Manager console, click the **Assets and Compliance** workspace &gt; **Device Collections**, and confirm that a new collection called **MBAM Supported Computers** is displayed.\n\n3.  In the Configuration Manager console, click the **Monitoring** workspace &gt; **Reporting** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **MBAM**.\n\n4.
