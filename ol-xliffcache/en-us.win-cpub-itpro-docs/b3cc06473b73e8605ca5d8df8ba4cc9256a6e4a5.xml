audit attempts to access registry objects. A security audit event is generated only for objects that have system access control lists ([SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)s) specified, and only if the type of access requested, such as Read, Write, or Modify, and the account making the request match the settings in the SACL.\n\nIf success auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any account successfully accesses a registry object that has a matching SACL. If failure auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any user unsuccessfully attempts to access a registry object that has a matching SACL.\n\n**Event volume**: Low to Medium, depending on how registry SACLs are configured.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | IF              | IF              | IF               | IF               | We strongly recommend that you develop a Registry Objects Security Monitoring policy and define appropriate [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)s for registry objects for different operating system templates and roles.
