# Create the build computer folder structure using IEAK 11
Create your build environment on the computer that you’ll use to build your custom browser package. Your license agreement determines your folder structure and which version of Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) you’ll use: **Internal** or **External**.

|Name             |Version               |Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|`\<root_folder>` |Internal and External |The main, placeholder folder used for all files built by IEAK or that you referenced in your custom package.|
|`\<root_folder>\Dist` |Internal only |Destination directory for your files. You’ll only need this folder if you’re creating your browser package on a network drive. |
