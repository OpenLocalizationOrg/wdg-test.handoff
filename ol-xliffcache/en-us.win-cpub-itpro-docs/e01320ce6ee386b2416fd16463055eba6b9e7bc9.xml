The priority levels are:\n\n-   **Priority 1 - Business Critical**. The highest priority level, applied to an item that is so important to your organization that a compatibility issue with the item would keep you from deploying a new operating system.\n\n-   **Priority 2 - Important**. Items that your organization regularly uses but can function without.\n\n-   **Priority 3 - Nice to Have**. Lower-priority items that you want to show in your compatibility reports that do not belong in either of the previous two categories.\n\n-   **Priority 4 - Unimportant**. Items that are irrelevant to the daily functions of your organization.\n\n-   **Unspecified**. The default priority level, applied to items that have not yet been reviewed for deployment.\n\n## Prioritizing Your Applications, Computers, Devices, and Websites\n\n\nThe following example uses the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen. You can alternatively use the **&lt;Application\\_Name&gt;** dialog box. The procedure is the same on the reports for computers, devices, and websites.\n\n**To change the priority**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click the name of the application.\n\n2.  On the **Actions** menu, click **Set Priority**.\n\n3.  Click a priority, and then click **OK**.\n\n**To filter your data by priority**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click **Toggle Filter**.\n\n2.  Enter your filter criteria, pressing the Tab key to add clauses.\n\n    Consider the following example, which shows a query that filters for all applications that have a priority level of **Business Critical** or **Important**.\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">And/Or</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Field</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Operator</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>And</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Priority</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Equals</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Priority 1 - Business Critical</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Or</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Priority</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Equals</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Priority 2 - Important</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n    To delete a clause, right-click the row, and then click **Delete Clause**.\n\n3.  Click **Refresh**.\n\n    Your filtered results appear.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
