require CTRL+ALT+DEL\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, and security considerations for the **Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis security setting determines whether pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before a user can log on.\n\nIf this policy setting is enabled on a device, a user is not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to log on. Not having to press CTRL+ALT+DEL leaves users susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept the users' passwords. Requiring CTRL+ALT+DEL before users log on ensures that users are communicating by means of a trusted path when entering their passwords.\n\nIf this policy is disabled, any user is required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL before logging on to the Windows operating system (unless they are using a smart card for logon).\n\nMicrosoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical impairments to log on to device running the Windows operating system; however, not having to press the CTRL+ALT+DELETE key combination leaves users susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. Requiring CTRL+ALT+DELETE before users log on ensures that users are communicating by means of a trusted path when entering their passwords.\n\nA malicious user might install malware that looks like the standard logon dialog box for the Windows operating system, and capture a user's password. The attacker can then log on to the compromised account with whatever level of user rights that user has.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n-   Disabled\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   It is advisable to set **Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL requirement for logon** to **Disabled**. Unless they are using a smart card to log on, users will have to simultaneously press three keys before the logon dialog box appears.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy | Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Policy conflict considerations\n\nBeginning with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, the CTRL+ALT+DELETE key combination is required to authenticate if this policy is disabled.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nThis policy setting can be configured by using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to be distributed through Group Policy Objects (GPOs). If this policy is not contained in a distributed GPO, this policy can be configured on the local computer by using the Local Security Policy snap-in.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nThis setting makes it easier for users with certain types of physical impairments to log on to devices that run the Windows operating system. However, if users are not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of a trusted path.\n\nIf this setting is enabled, an attacker could install malware that looks like the standard logon dialog box in the Windows operating system, and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nDisable the **Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nUnless they use a smart card to log on, users must simultaneously press the three keys before the logon dialog box is displayed.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
