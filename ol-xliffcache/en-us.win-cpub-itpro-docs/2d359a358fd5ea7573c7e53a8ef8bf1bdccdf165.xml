Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n“HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Control\\\\Lsa\\\\Audit\\\\SpecialGroups” registry value contains current list of SIDs which are included in Special Groups:\n\n<img src=\"images/registry-editor-audit.png\" alt=\"Registry Editor Audit key illustration\" width=\"1440\" height=\"335\" />\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4908(S): Special Groups Logon table modified.\n\n-   If you use the Special Groups feature, then this event should be always monitored, especially on high value assets or computers.
