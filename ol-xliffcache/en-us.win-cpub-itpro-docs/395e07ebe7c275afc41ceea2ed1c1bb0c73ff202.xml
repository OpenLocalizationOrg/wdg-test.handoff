Troubleshooting AGPM\n\n\nThis section lists common issues that you may encounter when you use Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) to manage Group Policy Objects (GPOs). To diagnose issues not listed here, it may be helpful for an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to use logging and tracing. For more information, see [Configure Logging and Tracing](configure-logging-and-tracing-agpm40.md).\n\n**Note**  \n-   For information about rolling back to an earlier version of a GPO if there are problems, see [Roll Back to an Earlier Version of a GPO](roll-back-to-an-earlier-version-of-a-gpo-agpm40.md).\n\n-   For information about how to recover from a disaster by restoring the complete archive from a backup, see [Restore the Archive from a Backup](restore-the-archive-from-a-backup-agpm40.md).\n\n \n\n## What problems are you having?\n\n\n-   [I am unable to access an archive](#bkmk-access-an-archive)\n\n-   [The GPO state varies for different Group Policy administrators](#bkmk-state-varies)\n\n-   [I am unable to modify the AGPM Server connection](#bkmk-modify-archive-location)\n\n-   [I am unable to change the default template or view, create, edit, rename, deploy, or delete GPOs](#bkmk-perform-task)\n\n-   [I am unable to use a particular GPO name](#bkmk-use-particular-name)\n\n-   [I am not receiving AGPM e-mail notifications](#bkmk-email)\n\n-   [I cannot use port 4600 for the AGPM Service](#bkmk-port)\n\n-   [The AGPM Service will not start](#bkmk-not-start)\n\n-   [Group Policy Software Installation fails to install software](#bkmk-software-installation)\n\n-   [An error occurred when I restored the archive to a new AGPM Server](#bkmk-error-on-restore)\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-access-an-archive\"></a>I am unable to access an archive\n\n-   **Cause**: You have not selected the correct server and port for the archive.\n\n-   **Solution**:\n\n    -   If you are an AGPM Administrator: See [Configure AGPM Server Connections](configure-agpm-server-connections-agpm40.md).\n\n    -   If you are not an AGPM Administrator: Request connection details for the AGPM Server from an AGPM Administrator.

For more information, see [Configure E-Mail Notification](configure-e-mail-notification-agpm40.md).\n\n    -   E-mail notifications are generated only when an Editor, Reviewer, or other Group Policy administrator who lacks the permission necessary to create, deploy, or delete a GPO submits a request for one of those actions to occur.
