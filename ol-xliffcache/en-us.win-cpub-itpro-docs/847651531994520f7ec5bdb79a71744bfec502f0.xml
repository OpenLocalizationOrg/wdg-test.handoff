MDT is one of the most important tools available to IT professionals today. You can use it to create reference images or as a complete deployment solution. MDT 2013 Update 2 also can be used to extend the operating system deployment features available in Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.\n\nIn addition to familiarizing you with the features and options available in MDT 2013 Update 2, this topic will walk you through the process of preparing for deploying Windows 10 using MDT by configuring Active Directory, creating an organizational unit (OU) structure, creating service accounts, configuring log files and folders, and installing the tools needed to view the logs and continue with the deployment process.\n\nFor the purposes of this topic, we will use two machines: DC01 and MDT01. DC01 is a domain controller and MDT01 is a Windows Server 2012 R2 standard server. MDT01 is a member of the domain contoso.com for the fictitious Contoso Corporation.
