This topic describes the available policy options for Group Policy Object (GPO) when you use MBAM to manage BitLocker Drive Encryption in the enterprise.\n\n**Important**  \nMBAM does not use the default GPO settings for Windows BitLocker drive encryption. If the default settings are enabled, they can cause conflicting behavior. To enable MBAM to manage BitLocker, you must define the GPO policy settings after you install the MBAM Group Policy Template.\n\n \n\nAfter you install the MBAM Group Policy template, you can view and modify the available custom MBAM GPO policy settings that enable MBAM to manage the enterprise BitLocker encryption. The MBAM Group Policy template must be installed on a computer that is capable of running the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) MDOP technology. Next, to edit the applicable GPO, open the GPMC or AGPM, and then navigate to the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\\\**Administrative Templates**\\\\**Windows Components**\\\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.\n\nThe MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management) GPO node contains four global policy settings and four child GPO setting nodes, respectively. The four GPO global policy settings are: Client Management, Fixed Drive, Operating System Drive, and Removable Drive. The following sections provide policy definitions and suggested policy settings to help you plan for the MBAM GPO policy setting requirements.\n\n**Note**  \nFor more information about configuring the minimum suggested GPO settings to enable MBAM to manage BitLocker encryption, see [How to Edit MBAM 1.0 GPO Settings](how-to-edit-mbam-10-gpo-settings.md).\n\n \n\n## Global policy definitions\n\n\nThis section describes the MBAM Global policy definitions, which can be found at the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\\\**Administrative Templates**\\\\**Windows Components**\\\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Policy Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Overview and Suggested Policy Setting</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to use a specific encryption method and cipher strength.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, BitLocker uses the default encryption method of AES 128-bit with Diffuser or the encryption method specified by the setup script.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Prevent memory overwrite on restart</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to improve restart performance without overwriting BitLocker secrets in memory on restart.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, BitLocker secrets are removed from memory when the computer restarts.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Validate smart card certificate usage rule</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to use smartcard certificate-based BitLocker protection.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, a default object identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.67.1.1 is used to specify a certificate.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Provide the unique identifiers for your organization</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to use a certificate-based data recovery agent or the BitLocker To Go reader.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, the <strong>Identification</strong> field is not used.</p>\n<p>If your company requires higher security measurements, you may want to configure the <strong>Identification</strong> field to make sure that all USB devices have this field set and that they are aligned with this Group Policy setting.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Client Management policy definitions\n\n\nThis section describes the Client Management policy definitions for MBAM, found at the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\\\**Administrative Templates**\\\\**Windows Components**\\\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)** \\\\ **Client Management**.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Policy Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Overview and Suggested Policy Settings</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Configure MBAM Services</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Enabled</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>MBAM Recovery and Hardware service endpoint</strong>.
