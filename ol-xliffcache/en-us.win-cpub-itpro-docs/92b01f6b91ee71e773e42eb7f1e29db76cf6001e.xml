This can be useful when you want to do the following:\n\n-   Organize many applications into more manageable subgroups.\n\n-   Create groups of applications specific to a department or other company division.\n\n-   Group similar types of applications, such as financial software.\n\n-   Simplify access permissions or license management by group.\n\n-   Change the properties of applications and application groups within a group simultaneously.\n\nYou can create a group, place it where you would like in the console's **Applications** tree, and import applications to the group. Then you can configure and manage the group's properties to affect all of its applications. You can also move applications among groups.\n\n**Note**  \nMoving applications into groups does not affect the locations of their files (SFT, OSD, or SPRJ) on the server's file system.\n\n \n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-create-an-application-group\"></a>[How to Create an Application Group](how-to-create-an-application-group.md)  \nProvides step-by-step instructions for creating an application group.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-move-an-application-group\"></a>[How to Move an Application Group](how-to-move-an-application-group.md)  \nProvides step-by-step instructions for moving an application group.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-rename-an-application-group\"></a>[How to Rename an Application Group](how-to-rename-an-application-group.md)  \nProvides step-by-step instructions for renaming an application group.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-remove-an-application-group\"></a>[How to Remove an Application Group](how-to-remove-an-application-group.md)  \nProvides step-by-step instructions for removing or deleting an application group.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Manage Applications in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-applications-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n[How to Perform Administrative Tasks in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console](how-to-perform-administrative-tasks-in-the-application-virtualization-server-management-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
