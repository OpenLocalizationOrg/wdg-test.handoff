for users who are already familiar with App-V and want to know what has changed in App-V 5.0 If you are not already familiar with App-V, you should start by reading [Planning for App-V 5.0](planning-for-app-v-50-rc.md).\n\n## Changes in Standard Functionality\n\n\nThe following sections contain information about the changes in standard functionality for App-V 5.0.\n\n### Changes to Supported Operating Systems\n\nFor more information, see [App-V 5.0 Supported Configurations](app-v-50-supported-configurations.md).\n\n## Changes to the sequencer\n\n\nThe following sections contain information about the changes in the App-V 5.0 sequencer.\n\n### Specific change to the sequencer\n\nThe following table displays information about what has changed with the App-V 5.0 sequencer\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Sequencer Feature</th>\n<th align=\"left\">App-V 5.0

The **Installation Report** page at the end of the sequencing wizard displays diagnostic messages categorized into **Errors**, **Warnings**, and **Info** depending on the severity of the issue.\n\nTo display more detailed information about an event, double-click the item you want to review in the report. The sequencing issues, as well as suggestions about how to resolve the issues are displayed. Information from the system preparation report and the installation report are summarized when you have finished creating a package. The following list displays the types of issues available in the report:\n\n-   Excluded files.\n\n-   Driver information.\n\n-   COM+ system differences.\n\n-   Side-by-side (SxS) conflicts.\n\n-   Shell Extensions.\n\n-   Information about unsupported services.\n\n-   DCOM.\n\n## Connection Groups\n\n\nThe App-V feature formerly known as **Dynamic Suite Composition** is now referred to as **Connection Groups** in App-V 5.0. For more information about using Connection Groups see [Managing Connection Groups](managing-connection-groups.md).\n\n## Licensing and Metering Functionality\n\n\nThe application and licensing functionality has been removed in App-V 5.0. The actual license positions in your environment depend on the specific software title license and usage rights granted by the associated license terms.\n\n## File and Application Cache\n\n\nThere is no file or application cache available with App-V 5.0.\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization). For App-V issues, use the [App-V TechNet Forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/home?forum=mdopappv).\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[About App-V 5.0](about-app-v-50.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
