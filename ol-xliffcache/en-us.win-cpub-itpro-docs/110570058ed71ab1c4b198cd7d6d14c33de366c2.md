| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [Access control](access-control.md) | Describes access control in Windows, which is the process of authorizing users, groups, and computers to access objects on the network or computer. Key concepts that make up access control are permissions, ownership of objects, inheritance of permissions, user rights, and object auditing. |
| [AppLocker](applocker-overview.md)| This topic provides a description of AppLocker and can help you decide if your organization can benefit from deploying AppLocker application control policies. AppLocker helps you control which apps and files users can run.

| [BitLocker](bitlocker-overview.md)| This topic provides a high-level overview of BitLocker, including a list of system requirements, practical applications, and deprecated features.|
| [Encrypted Hard Drive](encrypted-hard-drive.md) | Encrypted Hard Drive uses the rapid encryption that is provided by BitLocker Drive Encryption to enhance data security and management.|

| [User Account Control](user-account-control-overview.md)| User Account Control (UAC) helps prevent malware from damaging a PC and helps organizations deploy a better-managed desktop. With UAC, apps and tasks always run in the security context of a non-administrator account, unless an administrator specifically authorizes administrator-level access to the system. UAC can block the automatic installation of unauthorized apps and prevent inadvertent changes to system settings.|
| [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)| Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) is an out-of-the-box Windows enterprise security service that enables enterprise cybersecurity teams to detect and respond to advanced threats on their networks.|
| [Windows Defender in Windows 10](windows-defender-in-windows-10.md)| This topic provides an overview of Windows Defender, including a list of system requirements and new features.|
| [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](windows-firewall-with-advanced-security.md) | Windows Firewall with Advanced Security is an important part of a layered security model. By providing host-based, two-way network traffic filtering for a device, Windows Firewall with Advanced Security blocks unauthorized network traffic flowing into or out of the local device. |
