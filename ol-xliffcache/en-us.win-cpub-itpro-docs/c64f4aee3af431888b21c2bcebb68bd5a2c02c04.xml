Click the revertible MED-V workspace to configure.\n\n2.  In the **Revertible VM Setup** section, select the **Rename the VM based on the computer name pattern** check box.\n\n3.  In the **VM Computer Name Pattern** section, enter the pattern to use for naming virtual machine images, using the following options:\n\n    -   **Constant**—Enter free text that will be constant on all computers using the MED-V workspace.\n\n    -   **Variable**—Enter a variable, by clicking **Insert Variable**, and select from one of the following:\n\n        -   **User name**\n\n        -   **Domain name**\n\n        -   **Host name**\n\n        -   **Workspace name**\n\n        -   **Virtual machine name**\n\n        The variable selected will be specific to the computer using the MED-V workspace. For example, if **Domain name** is selected, the unique name for each computer will include the computer's domain name.\n\n    -   **Random characters**—Enter “\\#” for each random character to include in the pattern. Each computer using the MED-V workspace will have a suffix of the length specified, which is generated randomly.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The computer name has a limit of 15 characters. If the pattern exceeds the limit, it will be truncated.\n\n     \n\n4.  On the **Policy** menu, select **Commit**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    A revertible VM computer name pattern can be assigned only when **Rename the VM based on the computer name patterns** (in the **Revertible VM Setup** section) is checked.\n\n     \n\n    **Note**  \n    A unique computer name can be assigned only if it is configured prior to MED-V workspace setup. Changing the name will not affect MED-V workspaces that were already set up.\n\n     \n\n## How to Assign a Virtual Machine Computer Name Pattern to a Persistent MED-V Workspace\n\n\n**To assign a virtual machine computer name pattern to a persistent MED-V workspace**\n\n1.  Click the persistent MED-V workspace to configure.\n\n2.  In the **Persistent VM Setup** section, click **Script Editor**.\n\n3.  In the **Script Actions** dialog box, click **Add**, and on the submenu, click **Rename Computer**.\n\n4.  Click **OK** to close the **Script Actions** dialog box.\n\n5.  On the **VM Setup** tab, in the **VM Computer Name Pattern** section, enter the pattern to use for renaming the computer, using the following:\n\n    -   **Constant**— Enter free text that will be included in the computer name.\n\n    -   **Variable**—Enter a variable, by clicking **Insert Variable**, and select from one of the following:\n\n        -   **User name**\n\n        -   **Domain name**\n\n        -   **Host name**\n\n        -   **Workspace name**\n\n        -   **Virtual machine name**\n\n        The variable selected will be specific to the computer that is being renamed. For example, if **Domain name** is selected, the computer name will include the computer's domain name.\n\n    -   **Random characters**— Enter “\\#” for each random character to include in the pattern. The computer will have a suffix of the length specified, which is generated randomly.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The computer name has a limit of 15 characters. If the pattern exceeds the limit, it will be truncated.\n\n     \n\n6.  On the **Policy** menu, select **Commit**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The computer will be renamed only if it is set as an action in the **Script Actions** dialog box.
