For information about adding an issue, see [Adding or Editing an Issue](adding-or-editing-an-issue.md).\n\n**Note**  \nThe following example uses the **&lt;Application\\_Name&gt;** dialog box. The procedure is similar for websites.\n\n \n\n**To resolve issues**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, double-click the name of the application to display the **&lt;Application\\_Name&gt;** dialog box.\n\n2.  Click the **Issues** tab.\n\n3.  Double-click the specific issue to resolve.\n\n4.  On the **Actions** menu, click **Resolve**, and then close the **&lt;Application\\_Name&gt; - &lt;Issue\\_Title&gt;** dialog box.\n\n    The issue appears with a green check mark in the report details screen.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If you have not entered a solution but have resolved the issue, Microsoft recommends that you enter a solution with **Other** solution type and add text that describes why you resolved the issue without a solution.
