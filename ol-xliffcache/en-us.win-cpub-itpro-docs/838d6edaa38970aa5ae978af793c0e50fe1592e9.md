# Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

Describes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients** security policy setting.

## Reference

This policy setting allows a client device to require the negotiation of 128-bit encryption or NTLMv2 session security. These values are dependent on the **Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level policy** setting value.

### Possible values

-   Require NTLMv2 session security

    The connection fails if strong encryption (128-bit) is not negotiated.

-   Require 128-bit encryption

    The connection fails if the NTLMv2 protocol is not negotiated.

### Best practices

Practices in setting this policy are dependent on your security requirements.

### Location

Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options

### Default values

The following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policyâ€™s property page.

| Server type or GPO | Default value |
| - | - |
| Default Domain Policy | Not defined| 
| Default Domain Controller Policy| Not defined| 
| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| 
| DC Effective Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| 
| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| 
| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Require 128-bit encryption| 
 
## Policy management

This section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.

### Restart requirement

None. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.

### Policy conflicts

The settings for this security policy are dependent on the **Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level policy** setting value. For info about this policy, see [Network security: LAN Manager authentication level](network-security-lan-manager-authentication-level.md).

## Security considerations

This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.

### Vulnerability

Network traffic that uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) could be exposed such that an attacker who has gained access to the network can create man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Countermeasure

Enable all options that are available for the **Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients policy** setting.

### Potential impact

Client devices that enforce these settings cannot communicate with older servers that do not support them.
