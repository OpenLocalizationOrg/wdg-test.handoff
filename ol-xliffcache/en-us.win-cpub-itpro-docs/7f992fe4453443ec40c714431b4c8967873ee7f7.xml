Therefore you can install the management component to any computer on the network and then connect it to the App-V 5.0 database.\n\n[How to Move the App-V Server to Another Computer](how-to-move-the-app-v-server-to-another-computer.md)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"determine-if-an-app-v-5-0-application-is-running-virtualized-\"></a>Determine if an App-V 5.0 Application is Running Virtualized\n\n\nIndependent software vendors (ISV) who want to determine if an application is running virtualized with App-V 5.0 or above, should open a named object called **AppVVirtual-&lt;PID&gt;** in the default namespace. For example, Windows API **GetCurrentProcessId()** can be used to obtain the current process's ID, for example 4052, and then if a named Event object called **AppVVirtual-4052** can be successfully opened using **OpenEvent()** in the default namespace for read access, then the application is virtual. If the **OpenEvent()** call fails, the application is not virtual.\n\nAdditionally, ISV’s who want to explicitly virtualize or not virtualize calls on specific API’s with App-V 5.0 and above, can use the **VirtualizeCurrentThread()** and **CurrentThreadIsVirtualized()** functions implemented in the AppEntSubsystems32.dll module. These provide a way of hinting at a downstream component that the call should or should not be virtualized.\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization).
