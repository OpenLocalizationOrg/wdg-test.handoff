The Notice.txt file that displays the notice text is in the following root directory:\n\n&lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\\\Self Service Website\\\\\n\nTo display localized notice text, you create a localized Notice.txt file, and then save it under a specific language folder in the following example directory:\n\n&lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\\\Self Service Website\\\\\n\n**Note**  \nYou can configure the path by using the **NoticeTextPath** item in **Application Settings**.\n\n \n\nMBAM displays the notice text, based on the following rules:\n\n-   If you create a localized **Notice.txt** file in the appropriate language folder, MBAM displays the localized notice text if the default **Notice.txt** file exists. If the default **Notice.txt** file is missing, a message displays indicating that the default file is missing.\n\n-   If MBAM does not find a localized version of the Notice.txt file, it displays the text in the default Notice.txt file.\n\n-   If MBAM does not find a default Notice.txt file, it displays the default text in the Self-Service Portal.\n\n**Note**  \nIf an end user’s browser is set to a language that does not have a corresponding language subfolder or Notice.txt, the text in the Notice.txt file in the following root directory is displayed:\n\n&lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\\\Self Service Website\\\\\n\n \n\n**To create a localized Notice.txt file**\n\n1.  On the server where you configured the Self-Service Portal, create a &lt;*Language*&gt; folder in the following example directory, where &lt;*Language*&gt; represents the name of the localized language:\n\n    &lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\\\Self Service Website\\\\\n\n    **Note**  \n    Some language folders already exist, so you might not have to create a folder. If you do have to create a language folder, see [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317947) for a list of the valid names that you can use for the &lt;*Language*&gt; folder.\n\n     \n\n2.  Create a Notice.txt file that contains the localized notice text.\n\n3.  Save the Notice.txt file in the &lt;*Language*&gt; folder. For example, to create a localized Notice.txt file in Spanish, save the localized Notice.txt file in the following example directory:\n\n    &lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\\\Self Service Website\\\\Es-es\n\n    The name of the Language folder can also be the language neutral name **es** instead of **es-es**. If the end user’s browser is set to **es-es** and that folder does not exist, the parent locale (as defined in .NET) is recursively retrieved and checked, resolving to &lt;MBAM Self-Service Install Directory&gt;\\\\SelfServiceWebsite\\\\es\\\\Notice.txt before finally becoming the default Notice.txt file. This recursive fallback mimics the .NET resource loading rules.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for MBAM**?
