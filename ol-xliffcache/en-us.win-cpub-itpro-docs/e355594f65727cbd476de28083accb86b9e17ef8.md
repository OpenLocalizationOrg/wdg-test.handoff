When you deploy a runtime-analysis package, you are deploying it to your test environment for compatibility testing.

For information about creating the test environment, see [Creating an Enterprise Environment for Compatibility Testing](creating-an-enterprise-environment-for-compatibility-testing.md).

To deploy a runtime-analysis package, you can use the same deployment methods that you might use to deploy an inventory-collector package. For information about deployment methods, see [Deploying an Inventory-Collector Package](deploying-an-inventory-collector-package.md).
