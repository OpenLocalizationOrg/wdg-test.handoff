The resulting audit event is generated as follows:\n\n-   Success audits, when configured, record access attempts when the current central access policy grants access, but the proposed policy denies access.\n\n-   Failure audits, when configured, record access attempts when:\n\n    -   The current central access policy does not grant access, but the proposed policy grants access.\n\n    -   A principal requests the maximum access rights they are allowed and the access rights granted by the current central access policy are different than the access rights granted by the proposed policy.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | IF              | No              | IF               | No               | IF - Enable this subcategory if you need to test or troubleshoot Dynamic Access Control Proposed [Central Access Policies](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831425.aspx).<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n| Member Server     | IF              | No              | IF               | No               | IF - Enable this subcategory if you need to test or troubleshoot Dynamic Access Control Proposed [Central Access Policies](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831425.aspx).<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n| Workstation       | IF              | No              | IF               | No               | IF - Enable this subcategory if you need to test or troubleshoot Dynamic Access Control Proposed [Central Access Policies](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831425.aspx).<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4818](event-4818.md)(S): Proposed Central Access Policy does not grant the same access permissions as the current Central Access Policy.\n\n"}
