# Categorizing Your Compatibility Data


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows Server 2008 R2

To customize and filter your compatibility reports, you can create categories and subcategories to assign to your applications, computers, devices, and websites. By default, Microsoft provides the following categories:

-   
            **Software Vendor**. In this category, you can, for example, create a subcategory for each vendor. You can then use this category to generate reports by software vendor, which can be helpful when having discussions with a specific vendor or evaluating the vendorâ€™s performance relative to your compatibility requirements.

-   
            **Test Complexity**. You can use this category to help with planning and assigning test resources. You can, for example, create subcategories like Critical and Nice-to-Have.

Categories are extensible, multiple-selection string values, so you can use them for almost anything. For example, you can create a category for signoff from multiple owners so that software can be authorized only when all categories have been selected, indicating that each group has signed off.

As another example, you can create a category for unit of deployment. You can use subcategories such as Division and Region. You can use this category to track the software needs of a specific deployment unit. This way, you can see when the software required by the unit has been tested, approved, and is ready for deployment to the unit.

**Note**  
The following examples use the **&lt;Operating\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen. You can alternatively use the **&lt;Application\_Name&gt;** dialog box. You can also complete these procedures in the reports for computers, devices, and websites.

 

## Creating, Renaming, or Deleting Categories and Subcategories


You can manage your categories and subcategories from both the report screen and report-details screen.

**To create, rename, or delete a category or subcategory**

1.  On the **&lt;Operating\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click any application name.

2.  On the **Actions** menu, click **Assign Categories**.

3.  Click **Category List**.

4.  In the **Categories** or **Subcategories** area, do any or all of the following:

    -   Add a category or subcategory, by clicking **Add**. Type the name of your new category or subcategory, and then click outside the active text area.

        You must create at least one subcategory before a category will appear in the **Assign Categories** dialog box.

    -   Rename a category or subcategory, by selecting the item and then clicking **Rename**. Type the new name, and then click outside the active text area.

    -   Delete a category or subcategory, by selecting the item and then clicking **Remove**.

5.  After you have finished adding, renaming, and deleting categories and subcategories, click **OK** to close the **Category List** dialog box.

## Assigning Data to a Category and Subcategory


You can assign categories and subcategories from both the report screen and report-details screen.

**To assign and unassign categories and subcategories**

1.  On the **&lt;Operating\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click the application name.

2.  On the **Actions** menu, click **Assign Categories**.

3.  To assign a category, select the check box next to the applicable category or subcategory.

    To unassign a category, clear the check box.

4.  Click **OK**.

    You can use the query builder to filter based on this information.
