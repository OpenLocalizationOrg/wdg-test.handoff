For example, if a virtual machine containing Windows XP is delivered to a client running a local copy of Windows XP, MED-V will automatically remove the redundant Windows XP elements from the transfer. To ensure a valid and functional workspace, the MED-V client cryptographically verifies the integrity of local data before it is utilized, guaranteeing that the local blocks of data are absolutely bit-by-bit identical to those in the desired virtual machine image. Blocks that do not match are not used.\n\nThe process is bandwidth-efficient and transparent, and transfers run in the background, utilizing unused network and CPU resources.\n\nWhen updating to a new image version (for example, when administrators want to distribute a new application or patch), only the elements that have changed (\"deltas\") are downloaded, and not the entire virtual machine, significantly reducing the required network bandwidth and delivery time.\n\nYou can configure which folders are indexed on the host as part of the Trim Transfer protocol, based on the host operating system. These settings are configured in the *ClientSettings.xml* file, which can be found in the **Servers\\\\Configuration Server\\\\** folder.\n\nWhen applying new settings, the service must be restarted.\n\n``` syntax\n<HostIndexingXP type=\"System.String[]\"> \n- <ArrayOfString>\n<string>%WINDIR%</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Internet Explorer</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\MED-V</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Office</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Windows NT</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Messenger</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Adobe</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Outlook Express</string> \n</ArrayOfString> \n</HostIndexingXP> \n- <HostIndexingVista type=\"System.String[]\"> \n- <ArrayOfString> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\MSAgent</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\winsxs</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\system</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\system32</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\Microsoft.NET</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\SoftwareDistribution</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\L2Schemas</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\Cursors</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\Boot</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\Help</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\assembly</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\inf</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\fonts</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\Installer</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\IME</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\Resources</string> \n<string>%WINDIR%\\servicing</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\MED-V</string> \n<string>%ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Office</string> \n</ArrayOfString> \n</HostIndexingVista>\n```\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
