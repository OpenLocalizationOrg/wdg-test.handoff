Use the Sequencer to create a sequenced application that runs inside a virtual environment. The Sequencer packages the sequenced application and creates a virtual application that can be distributed to target computers and that runs in a self-contained, virtual environment. The virtual environment contains the information necessary to run the virtual application on the target computer without interacting with the operating system installed on the target computer.\n\nFor more information about the App-V Sequencer, see the following topics:\n\n-   [Application Virtualization Sequencer Overview](application-virtualization-sequencer-overview.md)\n\n-   [Sequencer Hardware and Software Requirements](sequencer-hardware-and-software-requirements.md)\n\n-   [Configuring the Application Virtualization Sequencer](configuring-the-application-virtualization-sequencer.md)\n\n-   [Tasks for the Application Virtualization Sequencer](tasks-for-the-application-virtualization-sequencer.md)\n\n-   [Troubleshooting the Application Virtualization Sequencer](troubleshooting-the-application-virtualization-sequencer.md)\n\n-   [Application Virtualization Sequencer Technical Reference](application-virtualization-sequencer-technical-reference-keep.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
