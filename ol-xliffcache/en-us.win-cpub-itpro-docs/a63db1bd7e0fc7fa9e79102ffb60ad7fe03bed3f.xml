Group Ignore the Package Version\n\n\nMicrosoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.1 lets you configure a connection group to use any version of a package, which simplifies package upgrades and reduces the number of connection groups you need to create.\n\nTo upgrade a package in some earlier versions of App-V, you had to perform several steps, including disabling the connection group and modifying the connection group’s XML definition file.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Task
