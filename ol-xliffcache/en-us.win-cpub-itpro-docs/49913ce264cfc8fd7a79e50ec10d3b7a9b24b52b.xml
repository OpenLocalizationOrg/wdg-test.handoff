Because all outbound network traffic is permitted, outbound rules are typically used to block traffic that is not wanted on the network. However, it is a best practice for an administrator to create outbound allow rules for those applications that are approved for use on the organization’s network. If you do this, then you have the option to set the default outbound behavior to block, preventing any network traffic that is not specifically authorized by the rules you create.\n\n**Checklist: Creating outbound firewall rules for Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2**\n\n| Task | Reference |\n| - | - |\n| Create a rule that allows a program to send any outbound network traffic on any port it requires. | [Create an Outbound Program or Service Rule](create-an-outbound-program-or-service-rule.md)| \n| Create a rule that allows outbound network traffic on a specified port number. | [Create an Outbound Port Rule](create-an-outbound-port-rule.md)| \n| Enable a predefined rule or a group of predefined rules.
