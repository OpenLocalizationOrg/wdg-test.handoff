# User State Migration Tool (USMT) Technical Reference
The User State Migration Tool (USMT) 10.0 is included with the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) for Windows 10. USMT provides a highly customizable user-profile migration experience for IT professionals.

Download the Windows ADK [from this website](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=526803).


            **Note**: USMT version 10.1.10586 supports migration of user settings for installations of Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013.

USMT 10.0 includes three command-line tools:

-   ScanState.exe

-   LoadState.exe

-   UsmtUtils.exe

USMT 10.0 also includes a set of three modifiable .xml files:

-   MigApp.xml

-   MigDocs.xml

-   MigUser.xml

Additionally, you can create custom .xml files to support your migration needs. You can also create a Config.xml file to specify files or settings to exclude from the migration.

USMT 10.0 tools can be used on several versions of Windows operating systems, for more information, see [USMT Requirements](usmt-requirements.md). For more information about previous releases of the USMT tools, see [User State Migration Tool (USMT) 4.0 User’s Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=246564).
