To show how you might use the SFTMIME QUERY OBJ command in your normal operations tasks, the following example demonstrates the process you would follow if you wanted to set the OVERRIDEURL parameter value for a specific package to specify a new path to the package content. \n\n1.  To find the package that you want to configure, run the following command:\n\n    `SFTMIME QUERY OBJ:PACKAGE`\n\n    This command returns each discovered package name as a GUID in the first column of output—for example, {AF78ABE1-57D4-4297-89DE-C308684AEDD6}.\n\n2.  To set the OVERRIDEURL parameter value, you use the SFTMIME [CONFIGURE PACKAGE](configure-package.md) command. For example, to set the OVERRIDEURL value for this package to a value of *\\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\mypackage.sft*, use the SFTMIME CONFIGURE PACKAGE command and give it the selected package GUID from the output of the SFTMIME QUERY OBJ command in step 1, followed by the OVERRIDEURL parameter and its new value, as follows:\n\n    `SFTMIME CONFIGURE PACKAGE:\"{AF78ABE1-57D4-4297-89DE-C308684AEDD6}\" /OVERRIDEURL \"\\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\mypackage.sft \"`\n\nFor version 4.6 SP2, the following option has been added.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>/NO-UPDATE-FTA-SHORTCUT</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Indicates the current state of the /NO-UPDATE-FTA-SHORTCUT flag.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[SFTMIME Command Reference](sftmime--command-reference.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
