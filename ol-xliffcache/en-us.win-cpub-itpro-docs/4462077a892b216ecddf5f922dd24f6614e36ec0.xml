BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) with the Configuration Manager Integration topology. The reports show BitLocker compliance for the enterprise and for individual computers and devices that MBAM manages. The reports provide tabular information and charts, and they have filters that let you view data from different perspectives.\n\nIn the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you view reports from Configuration Manager rather than from the Administration and Monitoring Website, with the exception of the **Recovery Audit Report**, which you continue to view from the Administration and Monitoring Website.\n\nFor information about MBAM reports for the Stand-alone topology, see [Viewing MBAM 2.5 Reports for the Stand-alone Topology](viewing-mbam-25-reports-for-the-stand-alone-topology.md).\n\n## Accessing reports in Configuration Manager\n\n\nTo access the Reports feature in Configuration Manager:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Version of Configuration Manager</th>\n<th align=\"left\">How to view the reports</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>System Center 2012 Configuration Manager</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><ol>\n<li><p>In the left pane, select the <strong>Monitoring</strong> workspace.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the tree, expand <strong>Overview</strong> &gt; <strong>Reporting</strong> &gt; <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>MBAM</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Select the folder that represents the language in which you want to view reports, and then select the report from the right pane.</p></li>\n</ol></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Configuration Manager 2007</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><ol>\n<li><p>In the left pane, expand <strong>Computer Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Reporting</strong> &gt; <strong>Reporting Services</strong> &gt; <strong>&lt;server name&gt;</strong> &gt; <strong>Report folders</strong> &gt; <strong>MBAM</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Select the folder that represents the language in which you want to view reports, and then select the report from the right pane.</p></li>\n</ol></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Description of reports in Configuration Manager\n\n\nThere are a few minor differences in the reports for the Configuration Manager Integration topology and the Stand-alone topology. The following sections describe the data in the MBAM reports for the Configuration Manager Integration topology:\n\n-   [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard](#bkmk-dashboard)\n\n-   [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details](#bkmk-compliancedetails)\n\n-   [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Summary](#bkmk-compliancesummary)\n\n-   [BitLocker Computer Compliance Report](#bkmk-compliancereport)\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-dashboard\"></a>BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard\n\nThe BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard provides the following graphs, which show BitLocker compliance status across the enterprise:\n\n-   Compliance Status Distribution\n\n-   Non Compliant Errors Distribution\n\n-   Compliance Status Distribution by Drive Type\n\n**Compliance Status Distribution**\n\nThis pie chart shows compliance status for computers within the enterprise. It also shows the percentage of computers, compared to the total number of computers in the selected collection, that has that compliance status. The actual number of computers with each status is also shown. The pie chart shows the following compliance statuses:\n\n-   Compliant\n\n-   Non Compliant\n\n-   User Exempt\n\n-   Temporary User Exempt\n\n-   Policy Not Enforced\n\n-   Unknown. These computers reported a status error, or they are part of the collection, but have never reported their compliance status. The lack of a compliance status could occur if the computer is disconnected from the organization.\n\n**Non Compliant Errors Distribution**\n\nThis pie chart shows the categories of computers in the enterprise that are not compliant with the BitLocker Drive Encryption policy, and shows the number of computers in each category. Each category percentage is calculated from the total number of non-compliant computers in the collection.\n\n-   User postponed encryption\n\n-   Unable to find compatible TPM\n\n-   System partition not available or large enough\n\n-   Policy conflict\n\n-   Waiting for TPM auto provisioning\n\n-   An unknown error has occurred\n\n-   No information. These computers do not have the MBAM Client installed, or they have the MBAM Client installed but not activated (for example, the service is not working).\n\n**Compliance Status Distribution by Drive Type**\n\nThis bar chart shows the current BitLocker compliance status by drive type. The statuses are **Compliant** and **Non Compliant**. Bars are shown for fixed data drives and operating system drives. Computers that do not have a fixed data drive are included and show a value only in the **Operating System Drive** bar.
