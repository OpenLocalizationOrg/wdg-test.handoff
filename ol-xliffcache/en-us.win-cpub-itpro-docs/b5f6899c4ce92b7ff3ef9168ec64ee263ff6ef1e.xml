This section includes information that can help you gather the necessary information to formulate a deployment plan that best meets your business requirements. If you are installing MBAM with the Configuration Manager topology, see [Planning to Deploy MBAM with Configuration Manager](planning-to-deploy-mbam-with-configuration-manager-2.md) for additional planning information.\n\n## Review the MBAM 2.0 Supported Configurations\n\n\nAfter preparing your computing environment for the MBAM Server and Client feature installation, make sure that you review the Supported Configurations to confirm that the computers on which you are installing MBAM meet the minimum hardware and operating system requirements. For more information about MBAM deployment prerequisites, see [MBAM 2.0 Deployment Prerequisites](mbam-20-deployment-prerequisites-mbam-2.md).\n\n[MBAM 2.0 Supported Configurations](mbam-20-supported-configurations-mbam-2.md)\n\n## Plan for MBAM 2.0 Server and Client Deployment\n\n\nThe MBAM Server infrastructure depends on a set of server features that can be installed on one or more server computers, based on the requirements of the enterprise. These features can be installed in a distributed configuration across multiple servers.\n\n**Note**  \nAn MBAM installation on a single server is recommended only for lab environments.\n\n \n\nThe MBAM Client enables administrators to enforce and monitor BitLocker drive encryption on computers in the enterprise. The BitLocker client can be integrated into an organization by deploying the client through an enterprise software delivery system or by installing the client agent on client computers as part of the initial imaging process.\n\nWith MBAM, you can encrypt a computer in your organization either before the end user receives the computer, or afterwards by using Group Policy.\n\n[Planning for MBAM 2.0 Server Deployment](planning-for-mbam-20-server-deployment-mbam-2.md)\n\n[Planning for MBAM 2.0 Client Deployment](planning-for-mbam-20-client-deployment-mbam-2.md)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"other-resources-for-mbam-planning-\"></a>Other Resources for MBAM Planning\n\n\n[Planning for MBAM 2.0](planning-for-mbam-20-mbam-2.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
