It is used to verify that the Management Server was installed and configured correctly, but it has to be published to the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Client so that the user can access it.\n\nUse the following procedures to publish the default application and to stream it.\n\n**To publish the default application**\n\n1.  Log on to the App-V Management Server by using an account that is a member of the App-V Administrators group specified during installation.\n\n2.  On the App-V Management Server, click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Application Virtualization Management Console**.\n\n3.  In the App-V Management Console, click **Actions**, and then click **Connect to Application Virtualization System**.\n\n4.  On the **Configure Connection** page, clear the **Use Secure Connection** check box.\n\n5.  In the **Web Service Host Name** box, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the App-V Management Server, and then click **OK**.\n\n    **Note**  \n    You can also use **localhost** for the Web Service Host name if it is installed on the Management Server.\n\n     \n\n6.  In the App-V Management Console, right-click the **Server** node, and click **System Options**.\n\n7.  On the **General** tab, in the **Default Content Path** box, enter the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to the Content folder you created on the server during installation; for example, \\\\\\\\&lt;Server Name&gt;\\\\Content, and then click **OK**.\n\n    **Important**  \n    Use the FQDN for the server name so that the client can resolve the name correctly.\n\n     \n\n8.  In the App-V Management Console, in the navigation pane, expand the **Server** node, and then click **Applications**.\n\n9.  In the topic pane, click **Default Application**, and then, in the **Actions** pane, click **Properties**.\n\n10. In the **Properties** dialog box, next to the **OSD Path** box, click **Browse**.\n\n11. In the **Open** dialog box, enter the UNC path to the Content folder you created on the server during installation; for example, \\\\\\\\&lt;Server Name&gt;\\\\Content, and press ENTER. You must use the actual server name and cannot use the **localhost** here.\n\n    **Important**  \n    Ensure that the values in both the **OSD Path** and **Icon Path** boxes are in UNC format (for example, \\\\\\\\&lt;Server Name&gt;\\\\Content\\\\DefaultApp.ico), and point to the Content folder you created when installing the server. Do not use **localhost** or a file path containing a drive letter such as C:\\\\Program Files\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Content.\n\n     \n\n12. Select the DefaultApp.osd file, and click **Open**.\n\n13. Repeat the previous steps to configure the icon path.\n\n14. Click the **Access Permissions** tab, and confirm that the App-V Users group has access permissions to the application.\n\n15. Click the **Shortcuts** tab, and then click **Publish to User’s Desktop**. Click **OK**.\n\n16. Open Windows Explorer, and locate the Content directory.\n\n17. Double-click the DefaultApp.osd file, and open it with Notepad.\n\n18. Locate the line that contains the **HREF** tag, and change it to the following code:\n\n         `CODEBASEHREF=”RTSP://<FQDN of your server>:554/DefaultApp.sft”`\n\n    Or, if you are using RTSPS:\n\n         `CODEBASEHREF=”RTSPS://<FQDN of your server>:322/DefaultApp.sft”`\n\n19. Close the DefaultApp.osd file, and save the changes.\n\n**To stream the default application**\n\n1.  On the computer that has the App-V Client installed, log on as a user who is a member of the Application Virtualization Users group specified during server installation.\n\n2.  On the desktop, the **Default Application Virtualization Application** shortcut appears. Double-click the shortcut to start the application.\n\n3.  A status bar, displayed above the Windows notification area, reports that the application is starting. If the application startup is successful, the title screen for the default application is displayed. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. You have now confirmed that the App-V system is running correctly.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Configure Servers for Server-Based Deployment](how-to-configure-servers-for-server-based-deployment.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
