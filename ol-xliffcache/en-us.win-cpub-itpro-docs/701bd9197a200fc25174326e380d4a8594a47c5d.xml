By using [Group Policy Objects](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=699279), Windows Update for Business is an easily established and implemented system which enables organizations and administrators to exercise control on how their Windows 10-based devices are updated, by allowing:\n-   **Deployment and validation groups**; where administrators can specify which devices go first in an update wave, and which devices will come later (to ensure any quality bars are met).\n-   **Peer-to-peer delivery**, which administrators can enable to make delivery of updates to branch offices and remote sites with limited bandwidth very efficient.\n-   **Use with existing tools** such as System Center Configuration Manager and the [Enterprise Mobility Suite](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=699281).\n\nTogether, these Windows Update for Business features help reduce device management costs, provide controls over update deployment, offer quicker access to security updates, as well as provide access to the latest innovations from Microsoft on an ongoing basis. Windows Update for Business is a free service for all Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions, and can be used independent of, or in conjunction with, existing device management solutions such as [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=734043) and [System Center Configuration Manager](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=734044).\n\n## Deploy Windows Update for Business in your organization\n\nFor Windows 10, version 1511, Windows Update for Business is enabled using a set of client-side configurations, allowing you to manage how and when Windows-based devices receive updates and upgrades. These capabilities use the Windows Update service like any other Windows 10 clients, but provides controls to help businesses validate update quality as well as time their update deployments to machines through the use of Group Policy Objects. Windows Update for Business also incorporates smart peer-to-peer networking for distribution of Windows updates, which will help maintain bandwidth efficiency in the absence of a WSUS solution.\n\n## Eligible devices\n\nAll devices running Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education on the Current Branch for Business (CBB) are Windows Update for Business eligible.\n\n## OS upgrades and updates\n\nIn Windows 10, Windows Update for Business recognizes three deployment categories that clients receive from Windows Update:\n-   **Upgrades**\n    -   Examples: Windows 10 (Build 10240) to Windows 10, version 1511; CBB 1 to CBB 2\n        **Note**  \n        In the Windows 10 servicing model, new CBBs will be declared 2-3 times per year.\n         \n-   **Updates**\n    -   General OS updates, typically released the second Tuesday of each month. These include Security, Critical, and Driver updates.\n-   **Other/non-deferrable**\n    -   Definition updates (these cannot be deferred)\nBoth upgrades and updates can be deferred from deployment to client machines by a Windows Update for Business administrator within a bounded rage of time from when those updates are first made available on the Windows Update service. This deferral capability allows administrators to validate deployments as they are pushed to all their Windows Update for Business enrolled clients. The following table defines maximum deferral periods allowed by deployment type:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Maximum deferral</th>\n<th>Deferral increments</th>\n<th>Classification type</th>\n<th>Classification GUID</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OS upgrades</td>\n<td>8 months</td>\n<td>1 month</td>\n<td>Upgrade</td>\n<td>3689BDC8-B205-4AF4-8D4A-A63924C5E9D5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"3\">OS updates</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\">4 weeks</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\">1 week</td>\n<td>Security updates</td>\n<td>0FA1201D-4330-4FA8-8AE9-B877473B6441</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Drivers</td>\n<td>EBFC1FC5-71A4-4F7B-9ACA-3B9A503104A0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Updates</td>\n<td>CD5FFD1E-E932-4E3A-BF74-18BF0B1BBD83</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other/non-deferrable</td>\n<td>No deferral</td>\n<td>No deferral</td>\n<td>Definition updates</td>\n<td>E0789628-CE08-4437-BE74-2495B842F43B</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## Related topics\n\n[Setup and deployment](setup-and-deployment.md)\n\n[Integration with management solutions](integration-with-management-solutions-.md)\n\n[Windows 10 servicing options for updates and upgrades](../manage/introduction-to-windows-10-servicing.md)\n"}
