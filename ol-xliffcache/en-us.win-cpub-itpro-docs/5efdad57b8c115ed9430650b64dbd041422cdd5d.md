-   Support for third-party Kerberos realms: App-V 4.5 SP1 provides support for environments that have a trust relationship and mapped user accounts between a Windows domain and an MIT Kerberos realm, which is a scenario commonly used at many universities. For information about how to enable this support, see [How to Configure the Client for MIT Kerberos Realm Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166004) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166004).

-   Customer Feedback and Hotfix Rollup: App-V 4.5 SP1 also includes a rollup of fixes to address issues found after the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.5 CU1 release. The updates result from a combination of known issues and customer feedback from our internal teams, partners, and customers who are using App-V 4.5.
