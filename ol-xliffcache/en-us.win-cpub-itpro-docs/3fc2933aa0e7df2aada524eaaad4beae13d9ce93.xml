For more information, see [Application Virtualization](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122939) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122939).\n\n4.  **Updating Software in the Core Image**\n\n    Although not considered a MED-V best practice, you can install software updates to applications on the core image. After you have installed the updates, you can then redeploy the MED-V workspace back out to your enterprise just as you deployed it originally.\n\n    **Important**  \n    We do not recommend this method of managing software updates. In addition, if you update software in the core image and redeploy the MED-V workspace back out to your enterprise, first time setup must run again, and any data saved in the virtual machine is lost.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Managing Automatic Updates for MED-V Workspaces](managing-automatic-updates-for-med-v-workspaces.md)\n\n[How to Test Application Publishing](how-to-test-application-publishing.md)\n\n[How to Publish and Unpublish an Application on the MED-V Workspace](how-to-publish-and-unpublish-an-application-on-the-med-v-workspace.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
