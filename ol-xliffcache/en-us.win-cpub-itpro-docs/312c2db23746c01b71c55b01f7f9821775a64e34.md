# How to Pack a MED-V Image


A MED-V image must be packed before it can be added to a deployment package or uploaded to the server.

**To create a packed MED-V image**

1.  Click the **Images** management button.

2.  In the **Images** module, in the **Local Packed Images** pane, click **New**.

3.  In the **Packed Image Creation** dialog box, select the virtual machine image by doing one of the following:

    -   In the **Base image file** field, type the full path to the directory where the Microsoft Virtual PC image prepared for MED-V is located.

    -   Click **Browse** to browse to the directory where the Microsoft Virtual PC image prepared for MED-V is located.

4.  Specify the name of the new image by doing one of the following:

    -   In the **Image name** field, type the desired name.

        **Note**  
        The following characters cannot be included in the image name: space " &lt;&gt; | \\ / : \* ?

         

        A new packed image will be created.

    -   From the drop-down list, select an existing name.

        A new version of the existing image will be created.

5.  Click **OK**.

    A new MED-V packed image is created on your host computer with the properties defined in the following table.

**Note**  
In the **Local Packed Images** and **Packed Images on Server** panes, the most recent version of each image is displayed as the parent node. Click the parent node to view all other existing versions of the image.
