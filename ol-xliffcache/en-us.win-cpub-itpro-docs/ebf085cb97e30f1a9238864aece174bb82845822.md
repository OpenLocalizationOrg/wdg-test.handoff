# How to Create a Time Limited Recovery Image


You can create a DaRT recovery image that can only be used for a certain number of days after it is generated. To do this, you must run the **DaRT Recovery Image Wizard** at a command prompt and specify the number of days.

**To create a recovery image that has a time limit**

1.  Open a Command Prompt with administrator credentials.

2.  Change the directory to the location of the ERDC.exe program.

3.  Using the following syntax, run the **DaRT Recovery Image Wizard**. 
            *NumberOfDays* is a positive integer that represents the number of days that the DaRT recovery image will be usable.

    ``` syntax
    ERDC /e NumberOfDays
    ```
