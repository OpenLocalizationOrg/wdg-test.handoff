Using the command line to create virtual applications is useful in the following scenarios:\n\n-   You need to create a large number of sequenced application packages.\n\n-   You need to create a sequenced application package on a recurring basis.\n\n**Important**  \nSequencing at the command prompt allows for default sequencing only. If you need to change default sequencing parameters, you must either manually modify a sequenced application package or re-sequence the application.\n\n \n\nAll subsequent modifications to existing sequenced application packages must be made using the sequencing wizard.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n\nTo sequence an application by using the command prompt, the following conditions must be met:\n\n-   The application that is about to be sequenced must not require changes or workarounds made to it outside the installer or Windows Installer package.\n\n-   Before sequencing, you must prepare a list of batch files for creating the sequenced application packages.\n\n-   Review For more information about the command line parameters, see [Command-Line Parameters](command-line-parameters.md).\n\n-   Review the errors that might be displayed when creating a sequenced application package by using the command line. For more information, see these errors, see [Command-Line Errors](command-line-errors.md).\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Manage Virtual Applications Using the Command Line](how-to-manage-virtual-applications-using-the-command-line.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
