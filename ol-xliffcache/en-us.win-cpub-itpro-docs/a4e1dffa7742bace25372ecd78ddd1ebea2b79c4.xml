In earlier versions of App-V, you could not prevent end users from performing these tasks.\n\n**To enable only administrators to publish or unpublish packages**\n\n1.  Navigate to the following Group Policy Object node:\n\n    **Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; App-V &gt; Publishing**.\n\n2.  Enable the **Require publish as administrator** Group Policy setting.\n\n    To alternatively use PowerShell to set this item, see [How to Manage App-V 5.1 Packages Running on a Stand-Alone Computer by Using PowerShell](how-to-manage-app-v-51-packages-running-on-a-stand-alone-computer-by-using-powershell.md#bkmk-admins-pub-pkgs).\n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
