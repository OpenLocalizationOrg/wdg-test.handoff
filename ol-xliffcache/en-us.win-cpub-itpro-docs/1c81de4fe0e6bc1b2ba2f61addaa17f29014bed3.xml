By using MED-V, you can easily configure, deploy, and manage corporate Windows Virtual PC images on any Windows-based desktop running Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Windows 7 Ultimate. The MED-V solution includes the following components:\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"---------------med-v-host\"></a> **MED-V Host**  \nA Windows 7 environment that includes a MED-V Host Agent, an electronic software distribution (ESD) system, a registry management system, and a MED-V guest. The MED-V host interacts with the MED-V guest so that certain setup functions and system information can be processed.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-------------------med-v-host-agent\"></a> **MED-V Host Agent**  \nThe MED-V software contained in the MED-V host that provides a channel to communicate with the MED-V guest. It also provides functionality such as first time setup and application publishing.\n\n**Note**  \nAfter MED-V and its required components are installed MED-V must be configured. The configuration of MED-V is referred to as first time setup.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"esd-system\"></a>**ESD System**  \nYour existing software distribution method that lets you deploy and install the MED-V workspace package files that MED-V creates.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"registry-management-system\"></a>**Registry Management System**  \nYour existing method of managing Group Policy settings and preferences.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"windows-virtual-pc-image\"></a>**Windows Virtual PC Image**  \nAn administrator-defined virtual machine that contains the following components:\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"corporate-operating-system\"></a>**Corporate Operating System**  \nYour standard corporate operating system.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"management-and-security-tools\"></a>**Management and Security Tools**  \nYour standard management and security tools, such as virus protection.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-----------------------med-v-guest\"></a> **MED-V Guest**  \nA Windows XP SP3 environment, as part of a Windows Virtual PC running on Windows 7 that contains the following components:\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"---------------------------med-v-guest-agent\"></a> **MED-V Guest Agent**  \nThe MED-V software contained in the MED-V guest that provides a channel to communicate with the MED-V host. It also supports the MED-V Host Agent with functions like performing first time setup.\n\n**Note**  \nThe MED-V Guest Agent is installed automatically during first time setup.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"esd-client\"></a>**ESD Client**  \nAn optional part of your ESD system that installs software packages and reports status to the ESD system.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Planning for Application Operating System Compatibility](planning-for-application-operating-system-compatibility.md)\n\n[Prepare the Deployment Environment for MED-V](prepare-the-deployment-environment-for-med-v.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
