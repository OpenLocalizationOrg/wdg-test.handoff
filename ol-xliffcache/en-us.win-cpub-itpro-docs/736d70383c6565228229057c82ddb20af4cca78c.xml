It's critical that students use a secure browser that prevents them from using other computer or Internet resources during the test. The **Take a Test** app in Windows 10, Version 1607, creates the right environment for taking a test:\n\n- **Take a Test** shows just the test and nothing else.\n- Students aren’t able to go to other websites.\n- Students can’t open or access other apps.\n- Students can't share, print, or record their screens.\n- Students can’t copy or paste.\n- Students can’t change settings, extend their display, see notifications, get updates, or use autofill features.\n- Cortana is turned off.\n\n\n\n## How you use Take a Test\n\n![Use test account or test url in Take a Test](images/take-a-test-flow.png)\n\n- **Use a test URL and a dedicated testing account** - A user signs in to the account and the **Take a Test** app automatically launches the pre-configured assessment URL in a single-app, kiosk mode. A student will never have access to the desktop in this configuration. We recommend this configuration for high stakes testing.\n- **Put a test URL with an included prefix on a web page or OneNote for students to click** - This allows teachers and test administrators an easier way to deploy assessments. We recommend this method for lower stakes assessments.\n\n[Learn how to set up Take a Test on a single PC](take-a-test-single-pc.md)\n\n[Learn how to set up Take a Test on multiple PCs](take-a-test-multiple-pcs.md)\n\n\n\n## Related topics\n\n[Take a Test app technical reference](take-a-test-app-technical.md)\n\n\n\n"}
