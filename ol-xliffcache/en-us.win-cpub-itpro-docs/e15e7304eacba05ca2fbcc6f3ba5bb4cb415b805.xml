Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “create user account” operation.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:\n\n    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO\n\n    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local\n\n    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL\n\n    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.\n\n    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.\n\n-   **Logon ID** \\[Type = HexInt64\\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”\n\n**New Account:**\n\n-   **Security ID** \\[Type = SID\\]**:** SID of created user account. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the user account that was created. For example: dadmin.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** domain name of created user account. Formats vary, and include the following:\n\n    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO\n\n    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local\n\n    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL\n\n    -   For local accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer to which this new account belongs, for example: “Win81”.\n\n**Attributes:**\n\n-   **SAM Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: logon name for account used to support clients and servers from previous versions of Windows (pre-Windows 2000 logon name). The value of **sAMAccountName** attribute of new user object. For example: ksmith. For local account this field contains the name of new user account.\n\n-   **Display Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the value of **displayName** attribute of new user object. It is a name displayed in the address book for a particular account .This is usually the combination of the user's first name, middle initial, and last name. For example, Ken Smith. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. Local accounts contain **Full Name** attribute in this field, but for new local accounts this field typically has value “**&lt;value not set&gt;**”.\n\n-   **User Principal Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: internet-style login name for the account, based on the Internet standard RFC 822. By convention this should map to the account's email name. This parameter contains the value of **userPrincipalName** attribute of new user object. For example, ksmith@contoso.local. For local users this field is not applicable and has value “**-**“. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example.\n\n-   **Home Directory** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: user's home directory. If **homeDrive** attribute is set and specifies a drive letter, **homeDirectory** should be a UNC path. The path must be a network UNC of the form \\\\\\\\Server\\\\Share\\\\Directory. This parameter contains the value of **homeDirectory** attribute of new user object. For new local accounts this field typically has value “**&lt;value not set&gt;**”. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”.\n\n-   **Home Drive** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** specifies the drive letter to which to map the UNC path specified by **homeDirectory** account’s attribute. The drive letter must be specified in the form “DRIVE\\_LETTER:”. For example – “H:”. This parameter contains the value of **homeDrive** attribute of new user object. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”. For new local accounts this field typically has value “**&lt;value not set&gt;**”.\n\n-   **Script Path** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** specifies the path of the account’s logon script. This parameter contains the value of **scriptPath** attribute of new user object. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”. For new local accounts this field typically has value “**&lt;value not set&gt;**”.\n\n-   **Profile Path** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: specifies a path to the account's profile. This value can be a null string, a local absolute path, or a UNC path. This parameter contains the value of **profilePath** attribute of new user object. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”. For new local accounts this field typically has value “**&lt;value not set&gt;**”.\n\n-   **User Workstations** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: contains the list of NetBIOS or DNS names of the computers from which the user can logon. Each computer name is separated by a comma. The name of a computer is the **sAMAccountName** property of a user object. This parameter contains the value of **userWorkstations** attribute of new user object. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”. For local users this field is not applicable and typically has value “**&lt;value not set&gt;**”.\n\n-   **Password Last Set** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** last time the account’s password was modified. For manually created user account, using Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, this field typically has value “**&lt;never&gt;”**. This parameter contains the value of **pwdLastSet** attribute of new user object.\n\n-   **Account Expires** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the date when the account expires. This parameter contains the value of **accountExpires** attribute of new user object. You can change this attribute by using Active Directory Users and Computers, or through a script, for example. This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “-”. For manually created local and domain user accounts this field typically has value “**&lt;never&gt;**”.\n\n-   **Primary Group ID** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: Relative Identifier (RID) of user’s object primary group.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Relative identifier (RID)** is a variable length number that is assigned to objects at creation and becomes part of the object's Security Identifier (SID) that uniquely identifies an account or group within a domain.\n\nTypically, **Primary Group** field for new user accounts has the following values:\n\n-   513 (Domain Users. For local accounts this RID means Users) – for domain and local users.\n\n    See this article <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330> for more information. This parameter contains the value of **primaryGroupID** attribute of new user object.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Allowed To Delegate To** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the list of SPNs to which this account can present delegated credentials. Can be changed using Active Directory Users and Computers management console in **Delegation** tab of user account, if this account has at least one SPN registered. This parameter contains the value of **AllowedToDelegateTo** attribute of new user object. For local user accounts this field is not applicable and typically has value “**-**“. For new domain user accounts it is typically has value “**-**“. See description of **AllowedToDelegateTo** field for “[4738](event-4738.md)(S): A user account was changed.” event for more details.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Service Principal Name (SPN)** is the name by which a client uniquely identifies an instance of a service. If you install multiple instances of a service on computers throughout a forest, each instance must have its own SPN. A given service instance can have multiple SPNs if there are multiple names that clients might use for authentication. For example, an SPN always includes the name of the host computer on which the service instance is running, so a service instance might register an SPN for each name or alias of its host.\n\n-   **Old UAC Value** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: specifies flags that control password, lockout, disable/enable, script, and other behavior for the user account. **Old UAC value** always **“0x0”** for new user accounts. This parameter contains the previous value of **userAccountControl** attribute of user object.\n\n-   **New UAC Value** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: specifies flags that control password, lockout, disable/enable, script, and other behavior for the user account. This parameter contains the value of **userAccountControl** attribute of new user object.\n\nTo decode this value, you can go through the property value definitions in the “Table 7. User’s or Computer’s account UAC flags.” from largest to smallest. Compare each property value to the flags value in the event. If the flags value in the event is greater than or equal to the property value, then the property is \"set\" and applies to that event. Subtract the property value from the flags value in the event and note that the flag applies and then go on to the next flag.\n\nHere's an example: Flags value from event: 0x15\n\nDecoding:\n\n• PASSWD\\_NOTREQD 0x0020\n\n• LOCKOUT 0x0010\n\n• HOMEDIR\\_REQUIRED 0x0008\n\n• (undeclared) 0x0004\n\n• ACCOUNTDISABLE 0x0002\n\n• SCRIPT 0x0001\n\n0x0020 &gt; 0x15, so PASSWD\\_NOTREQD does not apply to this event\n\n0x10 &lt; 0x15, so LOCKOUT applies to this event. 0x15 - 0x10 = 0x5\n\n0x4 &lt; 0x5, so the undeclared value is set. We'll pretend it doesn't mean anything. 0x5 - 0x4 = 0x1\n\n0x2 &gt; 0x1, so ACCOUNTDISABLE does not apply to this event\n\n0x1 = 0x1, so SCRIPT applies to this event. 0x1 - 0x1 = 0x0, we're done.\n\nSo this UAC flags value decodes to: LOCKOUT and SCRIPT\n\n-   **User Account Control** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** shows the list of changes in **userAccountControl** attribute. You will see a line of text for each change. For new user accounts, when the object for this account was created, the **userAccountControl** value was considered to be **“0x0”**, and then it was changed from **“0x0”** to the real value for the account's **userAccountControl** attribute. See possible values in the table below.
