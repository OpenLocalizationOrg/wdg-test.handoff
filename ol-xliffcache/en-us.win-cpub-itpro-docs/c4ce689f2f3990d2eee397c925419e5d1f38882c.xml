You also can group them so that you can change the properties of nested groups simultaneously.\n\n**To move an application group**\n\n1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, expand **Applications** so that you can see the **Application** group you want to move.\n\n2.  Right-click the group and choose **Move**.\n\n3.  In the **Select Target** window, navigate to the application group under which you want to place this group.\n\n4.  Click **OK**.\n\n    The group, all its subgroups, and its existing applications now appear under the target group. This move does not change the properties of the group or its applications.\n\n    **Note**  \n    You can select and move multiple application groups simultaneously. In the right pane, use the **CTRL**-click or **Shift**-click key combinations to select more than one group.\n\n     \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Create an Application Group](how-to-create-an-application-group.md)\n\n[How to Manage Application Groups in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-application-groups-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n[How to Manage Applications in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-applications-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
