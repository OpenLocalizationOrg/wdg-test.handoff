Each zone requires one GPO for each version of Windows running on devices in the zone. The Woodgrove Bank example has an isolation zone for their devices that run SQL Server. The server isolation zone is logically considered part of the encryption zone. Therefore, server isolation zone GPOs must also include rules for encrypting all isolated server traffic. Woodgrove Bank copied the encryption zone GPOs to serve as a starting point, and renamed them to reflect their new purpose.\n\nAll of the device accounts for devices in the SQL Server server isolation zone are added to the group CG\\_SRVISO\\_WGBANK\\_SQL. This group is granted Read and Apply Group Policy permissions in on the GPOs described in this section. The GPOs are only for server versions of Windows. Client devices are not expected to be members of the server isolation zone, although they can access the servers in the zone by being a member of a network access group (NAG) for the zone.\n\n## GPO\\_SRVISO\n\n\nThis GPO is identical to the GPO\\_DOMISO\\_Encryption GPO with the following changes:\n\n-   The firewall rule that enforces encryption is modified to include the NAGs on the **Users and Computers** tab of the rule. The NAGs granted permission include CG\\_NAG\\_SQL\\_Users and CG\\_NAG\\_SQL\\_Computers.\n\n    >**Important:**  Earlier versions of Windows support only device-based authentication. If you specify that user authentication is mandatory, only users on devices that are running at least Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 can connect.\n\n**Next: **[Planning GPO Deployment](planning-gpo-deployment.md)\n"}
