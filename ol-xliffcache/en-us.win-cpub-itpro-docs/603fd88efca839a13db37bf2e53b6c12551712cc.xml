NTLM: Audit NTLM authentication in this domain\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, management aspects, and security considerations for the **Network Security: Restrict NTLM: Audit NTLM authentication in this domain** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThe **Network Security: Restrict NTLM: Audit NTLM authentication in this domain** policy setting allows you to audit on the domain controller NTLM authentication in that domain.\n\nWhen you enable this policy setting on the domain controller, only authentication traffic to that domain controller will be logged.\n\nWhen you enable this audit policy, it functions in the same way as the **Network Security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain** policy setting, but it does not actually block any traffic. Therefore, you can use it effectively to understand the authentication traffic to your domain controllers and when you are ready to block that traffic, you can enable the **Network Security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain** policy setting and select **Deny for domain accounts to domain servers**, **Deny for domain servers**, or **Deny for domain accounts**.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   **Disable**\n\n    The domain controller on which this policy is set will not log events for incoming NTLM traffic.\n\n-   **Enable for domain accounts to domain servers**\n\n    The domain controller on which this policy is set will log events for NTLM authentication logon attempts for accounts in the domain to domain servers when NTLM authentication would be denied because the **Network security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain** policy setting is set to **Deny for domain accounts to domain servers**.\n\n-   **Enable for domain accounts**\n\n    The domain controller will log events for NTLM authentication logon attempts that use domain accounts when NTLM authentication would be denied because the **Network security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain** policy setting is set to **Deny for domain accounts**.\n\n-   Not defined\n\n    This is the same as **Disable** and results in no auditing of NTLM traffic.\n\n### Best practices\n\nDepending on your environment and the duration of your testing, monitor the operational event log size regularly.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default domain policy| Not defined| \n| Default domain controller policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-alone server default settings | Not defined| \n| Domain controller effective default settings | Not defined| \n| Member server effective default settings | Not defined| \n| Client computer effective default settings | Not defined| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes different features and tools available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a restart when saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nSetting and deploying this policy using Group Policy takes precedence over the setting on the local device. If the Group Policy is set to **Not Configured**, local settings will apply.\n\n### Auditing\n\nView the operational event log to see if this policy is functioning as intended. Audit and block events are recorded on this computer in the operational event log located in **Applications and Services Log\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\NTLM**. Using an audit event collection system can help you collect the events for analysis more efficiently.\n\nThere are no security audit event policies that can be configured to view output from this policy.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\nNTLM and NTLMv2 authentication is vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks, including SMB replay, man-in-the-middle attacks, and brute force attacks. Reducing and eliminating NTLM authentication from your environment forces the Windows operating system to use more secure protocols, such as the \nKerberos version 5 protocol, or different authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nEnabling this policy setting will reveal through logging which devices within your network or domain handle NTLM traffic. The identity of these devices can be used in malicious ways if NTLM authentication traffic is compromised. The policy setting does not prevent or mitigate any vulnerability because it is for audit purposes only.\n### Countermeasure\n\nRestrict access to the log files when this policy setting is enabled in your production environment.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nIf you do not enable or configure this policy setting, no NTLM authentication traffic information will be logged. If you do enable this policy setting, only auditing functions will occur; no security enhancements will be implemented.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
