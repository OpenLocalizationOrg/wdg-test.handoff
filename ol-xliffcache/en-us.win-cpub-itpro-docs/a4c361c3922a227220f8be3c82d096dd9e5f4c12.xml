For detailed procedures for installing the prerequisites and the App-V client, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144106>.\n\nWhen this has been completed, install the App-V 4.5 SP1 client by using setup.msi with elevated privileges. This file is available on the App-V 4.5 SP1 release media in the Installers\\\\Client folder.\n\nWhen installing Microsoft Application Error Reporting, use the following command if you are installing or upgrading to the App-V 4.5 SP1 Desktop client:\n\n    msiexec /i dw20shared.msi APPGUID={93468B43-C19D-44F9-8BCC-114076DB0443}  allusers=1 reboot=suppress REINSTALL=all REINSTALLMODE=vomus\n\nAlternatively, if you are installing or upgrading to the App-V 4.5 SP1 Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services), use the following command:\n\n    msiexec /i dw20shared.msi APPGUID={0042AD3C-99A4-4E58-B5F0-744D5AD96E1C} allusers=1 reboot=suppress REINSTALL=all REINSTALLMODE=vomus\n\n**Note**  \nThe APPGUID parameter references the product code of the App-V client that you install or upgrade. The product code is unique for each setup.msi. You can use the Orca database editor or a similar tool to examine Windows Installer files and determine the product code. This step is required for all installations or upgrades to App-V 4.5 SP1.\n\n \n\n### Improving performance when sequencing the .NET Framework\n\nWhen sequencing the .NET Framework, you might experience reduced system performance because the Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN service attempts to precompile assemblies as a background task.\n\nWORKAROUND   When sequencing the .NET Framework, disable the Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN service (mscorsvw.exe) after completing the monitoring phase. You must use the **Virtual Services** tab in the Sequencer and change the startup type to disabled.\n\n### When you uninstall the Microsoft Application Virtualization Client, user settings associated with the user performing the uninstall will be deleted\n\nWhen you uninstall the App-V Client, the Windows Installer will remove Application Virtualization settings from the current user's profile. If your computer uses roaming profiles, do not use your personal network account to uninstall the client because it will remove settings for your virtual applications on all of your computers.\n\nWORKAROUND   You should perform the App-V Client uninstall with an administrative account that is not used for running virtual applications.\n\n### Edits made on the virtual file system and virtual registry tabs must be saved while running the Sequencing wizard\n\nIf you open a package to perform an upgrade, or if you have already run the Sequencing wizard with a new package and make changes to the package in the virtual file system or virtual registry tabs, those changes are not automatically saved.\n\nWORKAROUND   Save the changes before re-running the wizard, to ensure that they are reflected inside the wizard’s virtual environment.\n\n### Command-line Sequencer must be run from an elevated command prompt\n\nWhen you use the command-line Sequencer, it does not prompt for elevation.\n\nWORKAROUND   Run the command-line Sequencer using an elevated command prompt.\n\n### Short path variable names in OSD files can cause errors\n\nIf you receive error 450478-1F702339-0000010B “The directory name is invalid” when starting a virtual application on the client, it is possible that the variable in the OSD is set incorrectly. This can happen if the application’s installer sets a short path name during sequencing.\n\nWORKAROUND   Remove the trailing tilde from any CSIDL variable that exists in the OSD file.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"correct-syntax-for-decodepath-parameter-for-command-line-sequencer-\"></a>Correct syntax for DECODEPATH parameter for command-line Sequencer\n\nIn the command-line Sequencer, when opening a package for upgrade and decoding it to the root of the Q drive, the syntax for the *DECODEPATH* parameter should not include a trailing slash.\n\nWORKAROUND   You can use **Q:** rather than **Q:\\\\** (omitting the trailing “\\\\” character).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"when-upgrading-4-2-packages--you-encounter-problems-caused-by-windows-installer-files-in-the-virtual-file-system-\"></a>When upgrading 4.2 packages, you encounter problems caused by Windows Installer files in the Virtual File System\n\nWhen upgrading a package from 4.2, you might experience issues relating to a mismatch of Windows Installer system files that were included by default in 4.2 and the Windows Installer libraries locally installed on your Sequencing workstation. The following files are located in CSIDL\\_SYSTEM\\\\:\n\ncabinet.dll\n\nmsi.dll\n\nmsiexec.exe\n\nmsihnd.dll\n\nmsimsg.dlll\n\nWORKAROUND   Delete all of the preceding files from the package. Delete the mappings on the **VFS** tab as well as the actual files in the CSIDL\\_SYSTEM folder in your decode path.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"on-windows-xp--client-install-logging-is-not-enabled-by-default-\"></a>On Windows XP, client install logging is not enabled by default\n\nWhen installing the client, to ensure that any install errors are captured for troubleshooting purposes, you should enable logging by using the command line.\n\nWORKAROUND   Add the parameter */l\\*vx! log.txt* to the command line, as shown in the following example:\n\nsetup.exe /s /v”/qn /l\\*vx! log.txt”\n\nmsiexec.exe /i setup.msi /qn /l\\*vx! log.txt\n\nAlternatively, you can set the registry key to the following value:\n\n\\[HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Installer\\] \"Logging\"=\"voicewarmupx!\"\n\n### For Kerberos authentication to work, Service Principal Names (SPNs) must be registered for IIS\n\nWhen using IIS 6.0 or 7.0 for icon or OSD file retrieval and streaming of packages, for Kerberos authentication to be enabled, the SPNs must be registered as follows:\n\n-   On the IIS server, run the following commands by using the SETSPN.EXE Resource Kit tool. The server fully qualified domain name (FQDN) must be used.\n\n    Setspn -r SOFTGRID/&lt;Server FQDN&gt;\n\n    Setspn -r HTTP/&lt;Server FQDN&gt;\n\nFor more information, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131407>.\n\n### .NET compatibility changes\n\nMicrosoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Cumulative Update 1 or later supports sequencing the .NET Framework on Windows XP (SP2 or later). Sequencing routines for .NET applications that were written for SoftGrid 4.2 might need to be updated when used with the App-V 4.5 Sequencer. For details and workarounds, please refer to the Knowledge Base article at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123412>.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"after-client-upgrade-from-app-v-4-2--some-applications-are-not-shown-\"></a>After client upgrade from App-V 4.2, some applications are not shown\n\nCheck for the following error in the log: ”The Application Virtualization Client could not parse the OSD file”. The App-V 4.5 client filters out applications that have an OSD file containing an empty OS tag (&lt;OS&gt;&lt;/OS&gt;).\n\nWORKAROUND   Delete the empty OS tag from the OSD file.\n\n### The App-V server requires exemptions in its firewall for certain processes\n\nFor the server to stream applications correctly, the server's core processes, including the dispatcher, need access through the firewall.\n\nWORKAROUND   Set exemptions in the server's firewall for the following processes: sghwsvr.exe and sghwdsptr.exe. This applies to the App-V Management Server and App-V Streaming Server.\n\n### When the server installer is run in silent mode, it does not correctly check for MSXML6\n\nThe App-V Management Server depends on MSXML6. However, if you run the installer in silent mode—for example, by using the command “msiexec -i setup.msi /qn” on a system where MSXML6 is not already installed—the installer does not detect the missing dependency and installs anyway. Therefore, when clients attempt to refresh publishing information from the App-V Management Server, they will see failures.\n\nWORKAROUND   Verify that MSXML6 is installed on the system before attempting a silent install of the App-V Management Server.\n\n### Error code 000C800 when attempting to connect to the Application Virtualization Management Console\n\nAn Application Virtualization administrator who is not a local administrator on the App-V Management Web Service server will receive an error (Error code: 000C800) when attempting to connect to the App-V Management Console, and the sftmmc.log entry will indicate that access to SftMgmt.udl is denied. To successfully connect to the App-V Management Console, an administrator who does not have local administrator rights on the App-V Management Web Service server must have at least read and execute permissions to the SftMgmt.udl file.\n\nThe Application Virtualization administrators must be given read and execute permissions to the SftMgmt.UDL file under %systemdrive%\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft System Center App Virt Management Server\\\\App Virt Management Service.\n\n### Client installer command-line parameters are ignored when used in conjunction with KEEPCURRENTSETTINGS=1\n\nWhen used in conjunction with KEEPCURRENTSETTINGS=1, the following client installer command-line parameters are ignored: SWICACHESIZE, MINFREESPACEMB, ALLOWINDEPENDENTFILESTREAMING, APPLICATIONSOURCEROOT, ICONSOURCEROOT, OSDSOURCEROOT, SYSTEMEVENTLOGLEVEL, SWIGLOBALDATA, DOTIMEOUTMINUTES, SWIFSDRIVE, AUTOLOADTARGET, AUTOLOADTRIGGERS, SWIUSERDATA, and REQUIRESECURECONNECTION.\n\nWORKAROUND   If you have settings you want to retain, use KEEPCURRENTSETTINGS=1 and then set the other parameters after deployment. The App-V ADM Template can be used to set the following client settings: APPLICATIONSOURCEROOT, ICONSOURCEROOT, OSDSOURCEROOT, AUTOLOADTARGET, AUTOLOADTRIGGERS, DOTIMEOUTMINUTES, and ALLOWINDEPENDENTFILESTREAMING. The ADM Template can be found at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121835>.\n\n## Release Notes Copyright Information\n\n\nInformation in this document, including URL and other Internet Web site references, is subject to change without notice and is provided for informational purposes only.
