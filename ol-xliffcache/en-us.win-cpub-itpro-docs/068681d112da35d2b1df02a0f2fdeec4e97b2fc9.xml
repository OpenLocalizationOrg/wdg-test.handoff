No further user-initiated activity can occur. This event can be interpreted as a logoff event.\n\nThe main difference with “[4634](event-4634.md)(S): An account was logged off.” event is that 4647 event is generated when logoff procedure was initiated by specific account using logoff function, and 4634 event shows that session was terminated and no longer exists.\n\n4647 is more typical for **Interactive** and **RemoteInteractive** logon types when user was logged off using standard methods. You will typically see both 4647 and 4634 events when logoff procedure was initiated by user.\n\nIt may be positively correlated with a “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.” event using the **Logon ID** value.

Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group.
