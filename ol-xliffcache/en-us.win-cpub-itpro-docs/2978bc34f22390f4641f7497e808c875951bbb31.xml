Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection onboarding issues\n\n**Applies to:**\n\n- Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14332 or later\n- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)\n\n<span style=\"color:#ED1C24;\">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>\n\nYou might need to troubleshoot the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection onboarding process if you encounter issues.\nThis page provides detailed steps for troubleshooting endpoints that aren't reporting correctly, and common error codes encountered during onboarding. <!--and steps for resolving problems with Azure Active Directory (AAD).-->\n\n## Endpoints are not reporting to the service correctly\n\nIf you have completed the endpoint onboarding process and don't see endpoints in the [Machines view](investigate-machines-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) after 20 minutes, it might indicate an endpoint onboarding or connectivity problem.\n\nGo through the following verification topics to address this issue:\n\n- [Ensure the endpoint is onboarded successfully](#Ensure-that-the-endpoint-is-onboarded-successfully)\n- [Ensure the Windows Defender ATP service is enabled](#Ensure-that-the-Windows-Defender-ATP-service-is-enabled)\n- [Ensure the telemetry and diagnostics service is enabled](#Ensure-that-telemetry-and-diagnostics-service-is-enabled)\n- [Ensure the endpoint has an Internet connection](#Ensure-that-the-Windows-Defender-ATP-endpoint-has-internet-connection)\n\n\n### Ensure the endpoint is onboarded successfully\nIf the endpoints aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows Defender ATP service was successfully onboarded onto the endpoint.\n\n**Check the onboarding state in Registry**:\n\n1. Click **Start**, type **Run**, and press **Enter**.\n\n2. From the **Run** dialog box, type **regedit** and press **Enter**.\n\n4. In the **Registry Editor** navigate to the Status key under:\n\n   ```text\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Advanced Threat Protection\n```\n\n5. Check the **OnboardingState** value is set to **1**.\n\n  ![Image of OnboardingState status in Registry Editor](images/onboardingstate.png)\n\nIf the **OnboardingState** value is not set to **1**, you can use Event Viewer to review errors on the endpoint.\n\n**Use Event Viewer to identify and adress onboarding errors**:   \n\n1. Click **Start**, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.\n\n2. In the **Event Viewer (Local)** pane, expand **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **SENSE**.\n\n    > **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Windows Defender ATP.\n\n3. Select **Operational** to load the log.\n\n4. In the **Action** pane, click **Filter Current log**.\n\n5. On the **Filter** tab, under **Event level:** select **Critical**, **Warning**, and **Error**, and click **OK**.\n\n  ![Image of Event Viewer log filter](images/filter-log.png)\n\n6. Events which can indicate issues will appear in the **Operational** pane. You can attempt to troubleshoot them based on the solutions in the following table:\n\nEvent ID | Message | Resolution steps\n:---|:---|:---\n5 | Windows Advanced Threat Protection service failed to connect to the server at _variable_ | [Ensure the endpoint has Internet access](#ensure-the-endpoint-has-an-internet-connection).\n6 | Windows Advanced Threat Protection service failed to read the onboarding parameters. Failure code: _variable_ | [Run the onboarding script again](configure-endpoints-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#manual).\n7 |  Windows Advanced Threat Protection service failed to read the onboarding parameters. Failure code: _variable_ | [Ensure the endpoint has Internet access](#ensure-the-endpoint-has-an-internet-connection), then [run the onboarding script again](configure-endpoints-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#manual).\n15 | Windows Advanced Threat Protection cannot start command channel with URL: _variable_ | [Ensure the endpoint has Internet access](#ensure-the-endpoint-has-an-internet-connection).\n\n\n### Ensure the Windows Defender ATP service is enabled\nIf the endpoints aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows Defender ATP service is set to automatically start and is running on the endpoint.\n\nYou can use the SC command line program for checking and managing the startup type and running state of the service.\n\n**Check the Windows Defender ATP service startup type from the command line:**\n\n1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:\n\n  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.\n\n  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.\n\n2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc qc sense\n    ```\n\nIf the the service is running, then the result should look like the following screenshot:\n\n  ![Result of the sq query sense command](images/sc-query-sense-autostart.png)\n\nIf the service **START_TYPE** is not set to **AUTO_START**, then you'll need to set the service to automatically start.\n\n**Change the Windows Defender ATP service startup type from the command line:**\n\n1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:\n\n  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.\n\n  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.\n\n2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc config sense start=auto\n    ```\n\n3.  A success message is displayed. Verify the change by entering the following command and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc qc sense\n    ```\n\n**Check the Windows Defender ATP service is running from the command line:**\n\n1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:\n\n  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.\n\n  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.\n\n2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc query sense\n    ```\n\nIf the service is running, the result should look like the following screenshot:\n\n![Result of the sc query sense command](images/sc-query-sense-running.png)\n\nIf the service **STATE** is not set to **RUNNING**, then you'll need to start it.\n\n**Start the Windows Defender ATP service from the command line:**\n\n1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:\n\n  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.\n\n  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.\n\n2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc start sense\n    ```\n\n3.  A success message is displayed. Verify the change by entering the following command and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc qc sense\n    ```\n\n### Ensure the telemetry and diagnostics service is enabled\nIf the endpoints aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service is set to automatically start and is running on the endpoint. The service may have been disabled by other programs or user configuration changes.\n\n\nFirst, you should check that the service is set to start automatically when Windows starts, then you should check that the service is currently running (and start it if it isn't).\n\n### Ensure the service is set to start\n\n**Use the command line to check the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service startup type**:\n\n1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:\n\n  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.\n\n  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.\n\n2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:\n\n    ```text\n    sc qc diagtrack\n    ```\n\nIf the service is enabled, then the result should look like the following screenshot:\n\n![Result of the sc query command for diagtrack](images/windefatp-sc-qc-diagtrack.png)\n\nIf the **START_TYPE** is not set to **AUTO_START**, then you'll need to set the service to automatically start.\n\n\n\n**Use the command line to set the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service to automatically start:**\n\n1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:\n\n  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.\n\n  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.\n\n2.
