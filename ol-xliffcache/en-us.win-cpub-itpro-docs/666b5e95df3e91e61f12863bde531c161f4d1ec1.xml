To see that the operation was performed, check “[4663](event-4663.md)(S): An attempt was made to access an object.”\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.\n\n***Event XML***:\n```\n- <Event xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event\">\n- <System>\n <Provider Name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing\" Guid=\"{54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D}\" /> \n <EventID>4656</EventID> \n <Version>1</Version> \n <Level>0</Level> \n <Task>12800</Task> \n <Opcode>0</Opcode> \n <Keywords>0x8010000000000000</Keywords> \n <TimeCreated SystemTime=\"2015-09-18T22:15:19.346776600Z\" /> \n <EventRecordID>274057</EventRecordID> \n <Correlation /> \n <Execution ProcessID=\"516\" ThreadID=\"524\" /> \n <Channel>Security</Channel> \n <Computer>DC01.contoso.local</Computer> \n <Security /> \n </System>\n- <EventData>\n <Data Name=\"SubjectUserSid\">S-1-5-21-3457937927-2839227994-823803824-1104</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectUserName\">dadmin</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectDomainName\">CONTOSO</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectLogonId\">0x4367b</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ObjectServer\">Security</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ObjectType\">File</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ObjectName\">C:\\\\Documents\\\\HBI Data.txt</Data> \n <Data Name=\"HandleId\">0x0</Data> \n <Data Name=\"TransactionId\">{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}</Data> \n <Data Name=\"AccessList\">%%1538 %%1541 %%4416 %%4417 %%4418 %%4419 %%4420 %%4423 %%4424</Data> \n <Data Name=\"AccessReason\">%%1538: %%1804 %%1541: %%1809 %%4416: %%1809 %%4417: %%1809 %%4418: %%1802 D:(D;;LC;;;S-1-5-21-3457937927-2839227994-823803824-1104) %%4419: %%1809 %%4420: %%1809 %%4423: %%1811 D:(A;OICI;FA;;;S-1-5-21-3457937927-2839227994-823803824-1104) %%4424: %%1809</Data> \n <Data Name=\"AccessMask\">0x12019f</Data> \n <Data Name=\"PrivilegeList\">-</Data> \n <Data Name=\"RestrictedSidCount\">0</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ProcessId\">0x1074</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ProcessName\">C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\notepad.exe</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ResourceAttributes\">S:AI(RA;ID;;;;WD;(\"Impact\\_MS\",TI,0x10020,3000))</Data> \n </EventData>\n </Event>\n\n```\n\n***Required Server Roles:*** None.\n\n***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.\n\n***Event Versions:***\n\n-   0 - Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.\n\n-   1 - Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.\n\n    -   Added “Resource Attributes” field.\n\n    -   Added “Access Reasons” field.\n\n***Field Descriptions:***\n\n**Subject:**\n\n-   **Security ID** \\[Type = SID\\]**:** SID of account that requested a handle to an object. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the account that requested a handle to an object.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:\n\n    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO\n\n    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local\n\n    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL\n\n    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.\n\n    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.\n\n-   **Logon ID** \\[Type = HexInt64\\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”\n\n**Object**:\n\n-   **Object Server** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: has “**Security**” value for this event.\n\n-   **Object Type** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: The type of an object that was accessed during the operation.\n\n    The following table contains the list of the most common **Object Types**:\n\n| Directory               | Event        | Timer                | Device       |\n|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|\n| Mutant                  | Type         | File                 | Token        |\n| Thread                  | Section      | WindowStation        | DebugObject  |\n| FilterCommunicationPort | EventPair    | Driver               | IoCompletion |\n| Controller              | SymbolicLink | WmiGuid              | Process      |\n| Profile                 | Desktop      | KeyedEvent           | Adapter      |\n| Key                     | WaitablePort | Callback             | Semaphore    |\n| Job                     | Port         | FilterConnectionPort | ALPC Port    |\n\n-   **Object Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: name and other identifying information for the object for which access was requested. For example, for a file, the path would be included.\n\n-   **Handle ID** \\[Type = Pointer\\]: hexadecimal value of a handle to **Object Name**. This field can help you correlate this event with other events that might contain the same Handle ID, for example, “[4663](event-4663.md)(S): An attempt was made to access an object.” This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “0x0”.\n\n-   **Resource Attributes** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\] \\[Version 1\\]: attributes associated with the object. For some objects, the field does not apply and “-“ is displayed.\n\n    For example, for a file, the following might be displayed: S:AI(RA;ID;;;;WD;(\"Impact\\_MS\",TI,0x10020,3000))\n\n    -   Impact\\_MS: Resource Property ***ID***.\n\n    -   3000: Recourse Property ***Value***.\n\n<img src=\"images/impact-property.png\" alt=\"Impact property illustration\" width=\"886\" height=\"592\" />\n\n**Process Information:**\n\n-   **Process ID** \\[Type = Pointer\\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process through which the access was requested. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):\n\n    <img src=\"images/task-manager.png\" alt=\"Task manager illustration\" width=\"585\" height=\"375\" />\n\n    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.\n\n    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\\\New Process ID**.\n\n-   **Process Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.\n\n**Access Request Information:**\n\n-   **Transaction ID** \\[Type = GUID\\]: unique GUID of the transaction. This field can help you correlate this event with other events that might contain the same **Transaction ID**, such as “[4660](event-4660.md)(S): An object was deleted.”\n\n    This parameter might not be captured in the event, and in that case appears as “{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}”.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**GUID** is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier'. It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources, activities or instances.\n\n-   **Accesses** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the list of access rights which were requested by **Subject\\\\Security ID**. These access rights depend on **Object Type**. The following table contains information about the most common access rights for file system objects. Access rights for registry objects are often similar to file system objects, but the table contains a few notes about how they vary.\n\n| <span id=\"File_system_objects_access_rights\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Access             | Hexadecimal Value,<br>Schema Value  | Description    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| ReadData (or ListDirectory)<br><br>(For registry objects, this is “Query key value.”) | 0x1,<br>%%4416                | **ReadData -** For a file object, the right to read the corresponding file data.

Applicable to only specific **Object Types**.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4656(S, F): A handle to an object was requested.\n\nFor kernel objects, this event and other auditing events have little to no security relevance and are hard to parse or analyze. There is no recommendation for auditing them, unless you know exactly what you need to monitor at the Kernel objects level.\n\nFor other types of objects, the following recommendations apply.\n\n> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).\n\n-   If you have a pre-defined “**Process Name**” for the process reported in this event, monitor all events with “**Process Name**” not equal to your defined value.\n\n-   You can monitor to see if “**Process Name**” is not in a standard folder (for example, not in **System32** or **Program Files**) or is in a restricted folder (for example, **Temporary Internet Files**).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   If you have a pre-defined list of restricted substrings or words in process names (for example, “**mimikatz**” or “**cain.exe**”), check for these substrings in “**Process Name**.”\n\n-   If **Object Name** is a sensitive or critical object for which you need to monitor any access attempt, monitor all [4656](event-4656.md) events.\n\n-   If **Object Name** is a sensitive or critical object for which you need to monitor specific access attempts (for example, only write actions), monitor for all [4656](event-4656.md) events with the corresponding **Access Request Information\\\\Accesses** values.\n\n-   If you need to monitor files and folders with specific Resource Attribute values, monitor for all [4656](event-4656.md) events with specific **Resource Attributes** field values.\n\n    For file system objects, we recommend that you monitor these **Access Request Information\\\\Accesses** rights (especially for Failure events):\n\n    -   WriteData (or AddFile)\n\n    -   AppendData (or AddSubdirectory or CreatePipeInstance)\n\n    -   WriteEA\n\n    -   DeleteChild\n\n    -   WriteAttributes\n\n    -   DELETE\n\n    -   WRITE\\_DAC\n\n    -   WRITE\\_OWNER\n\n"}
