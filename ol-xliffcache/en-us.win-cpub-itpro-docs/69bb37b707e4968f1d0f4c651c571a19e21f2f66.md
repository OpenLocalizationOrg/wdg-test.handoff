# Set up Take a Test on multiple PCs (Preview)
**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10 Insider Preview  


> <span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here. ]</span>

Many schools use online testing for formative and summative assessments. It's critical that students use a secure browser that prevents them from using other computer or Internet resources during the test. The **Take a Test** app in Windows 10, Version 1607, creates the right environment for taking a test:

- A Microsoft Edge browser window opens, showing just the test and nothing else.
- Students aren’t able to go to other websites.
- Students can’t open or access other apps.
- Students can't share, print, or record their screens.
- Students can’t copy or paste.
- Students can’t change settings, extend their display, see notifications, get updates, or use autofill features.
- Cortana is turned off.




## How you use Take a Test

![Use test account or test url in Take a Test](images/take-a-test-flow.png)

- 
            **Use a test URL and a [dedicated testing account](#set-up-a-dedicated-test-account)** - A user signs in to the account and the **Take a Test** app automatically launches the pre-configured assessment URL in Microsoft Edge in a single-app, kiosk mode. A student will never have access to the desktop in this configuration. We recommend this configuration for high stakes testing.
- 
            **              [Put a test URL with an included prefix](#provide-link-to-test) on a web page or OneNote for students to click** - This allows teachers and test administrators an easier way to deploy assessments. We recommend this method for lower stakes assessments.

## Set up a dedicated test account

To configure a dedicated test account on multiple PCs, you can use:
- [Mobile device management (MDM) or Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager](#set-up-test-account-in-mdm-or-configuration-manager)
- 
            [A provisioning package](#set-up-test-account-in-a-provisioning-package) created in Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD)
- 
            [Group Policy](#set-up-test-account-in-group-policy) to deploy a scheduled task that runs a Powershell script
    

### Set up test account in MDM or Configuration Manager

1. Launch your management console.
2. Create a policy to set up single app kiosk mode, using the following values:

    - 
            **Custom OMA-DM URI** = ./Vendor/MSFT/AssignedAccess/KioskModeApp
    - 
            **String value** = {"Account":"*redmond\\kioskuser*","AUMID":” Microsoft.Windows.SecureAssessmentBrowser_cw5n1h2txyewy!App "}

    > Account can be in one of the following formats:
    > - username
    > - domain\username
    > - computer name\\username
    > - username@tenant.com

3. Create a policy to configure the assessment URL, using the following values:

    - 
            **Custom OMA-DM URI** = ./Vendor/MSFT/SecureAssessment/LaunchURI
    - 
            **String value**             =             *assessment URL*
          
    > See [Assessment URLs](#assessment-urls)
    
4. Create a policy that associates the assessment URL to the account, using the following values:

    - 
            **Custom OMA-DM URI** = ./Vendor/MSFT/SecureAssessment/TesterAccount
    - 
            **String value** = Enter the account that you specified in step 2, using the same account format.
    
5. To take the test, the student signs in to the test account.

### Set up test account in a provisioning package

Prerequisite: You must first [download the Windows ADK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/dn913721.aspx) for Windows 10, Version 1607, and  install Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD).

**Create a provisioning package to set up a test account

1. Open Windows ICD (by default, %windir%\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Imaging and Configuration Designer\x86\ICD.exe). 
2. Select **Advanced provisioning**.
3. Name your project, and click **Next**.
4. Select **All Windows desktop editions**, and click **Next**.
5. Click **Finish**.
6. Go to **Runtime settings** > **AssignedAccess** > **AssignedAccessSettings**. 
7. Enter **{"Account":"*redmond\\kioskuser*","AUMID":” Microsoft.Windows.SecureAssessmentBrowser_cw5n1h2txyewy!App "}**, using the account that you want to set up, as shown in the following image.

    ![Enter account and app for Assigned Access Settings](images/test-account-icd.png)
    > Account can be in one of the following formats:
    > - username
    > - domain\username
    > - computer name\\username
    > - username@tenant.com
    
8. Go to **Runtime settings** > **TakeATest**.
9. Enter the test URL in **LaunchURI**.
10. Enter the test account from step 7 in **TesterAccount**.
On the **File** menu, select **Save.**

9.  On the **Export** menu, select **Provisioning package**.

10. Change **Owner** to **IT Admin**, which will set the precedence of this provisioning package higher than provisioning packages applied to this device from other sources, and then select **Next.**

11. Optional. In the **Provisioning package security** window, you can choose to encrypt the package and enable package signing.

    -   
            **Enable package encryption** - If you select this option, an auto-generated password will be shown on the screen.

    -   
            **Enable package signing** - If you select this option, you must select a valid certificate to use for signing the package. You can specify the certificate by clicking **Select** and choosing the certificate you want to use to sign the package.

12. Click **Next** to specify the output location where you want the provisioning package to go when it's built. By default, Windows ICD uses the project folder as the output location.

    Optionally, you can click **Browse** to change the default output location.

13. Click **Next**.

14. Click **Build** to start building the package. The provisioning package doesn't take long to build. The project information is displayed in the build page and the progress bar indicates the build status.

    If you need to cancel the build, click **Cancel**. This cancels the current build process, closes the wizard, and takes you back to the **Customizations Page**.

15. If your build fails, an error message will show up that includes a link to the project folder. You can scan the logs to determine what caused the error. Once you fix the issue, try building the package again.

    If your build is successful, the name of the provisioning package, output directory, and project directory will be shown.

    -   If you choose, you can build the provisioning package again and pick a different path for the output package. To do this, click **Back** to change the output package name and path, and then click **Next** to start another build.
    -   If you are done, click **Finish** to close the wizard and go back to the **Customizations Page**. 

 **Apply the provisioning package**
 
 1.  Select the provisioning package that you want to apply, double-click the file, and then allow admin privileges.

2.  Consent to allow the package to be installed.

    After you allow the package to be installed, the settings will be applied to the device

### Set up test account in Group Policy

To set up a test account using Group Policy, first create a Powershell script that configures the test account and test URL, and then create a scheduled task to run the script.

#### Create a Powershell script

This sample Powershell script configures the test account and the test URL. Edit the sample to: 
- Use your test account for **$obj.LaunchURI**  
- Use your test URL for **$obj.TesterAccount**
- Use your test account for **-UserName** 

```
$obj = get-wmiobject -namespace root/cimv2/mdm/dmmap -class MDM_SecureAssessment -filter "InstanceID='SecureAssessment' AND ParentID='./Vendor/MSFT'"; 
$obj.LaunchURI='http://www.foo.com'; 
$obj.TesterAccount='TestAccount'; 
$obj.put()
Set-AssignedAccess -AppUserModelId Microsoft.Windows.SecureAssessmentBrowser_cw5n1h2txyewy!App -UserName TestAccount
```


#### Create a scheduled task in Group Policy

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console. 
2. Right-click the Group Policy object (GPO) that should contain the new preference item, and then click **Edit**.
3. In the console tree under **Computer Configuration** or **User Configuration**, go to **Preferences** > **Control Panel Settings**.
4. Right-click **Scheduled Tasks**, point to **New**, and select **Scheduled Task**.
5. In the **New Scheduled Task Properties** dialog box, click **Change User or Group**.
6. In the **Select User or Group** dialog box, click **Advanced**.
7. In the **Advanced** dialog box, click **Find Now**.
8. Select **System** in the search results
9. Go back to the **Properties** dialog box and select **Run with highest privileges** under **Security options**.
9. Specify the operating system in the **Configure for** field.
9. Navigate to the **Actions** tab.
9. Create a new **Action**.
9. Configure the action to **Start a program**.
9. In the **Program/script** field, enter **powershell**.
9. In the **Add arguments** field, enter **-file “<path to powershell script>”**.
9. Click **OK**.
9. Navigate to the **Triggers** tab and create a new trigger.
9. Specify the trigger to be **On a schedule**.
9. Specify the trigger to be **One time**.
9. Specify the time the trigger should start.
9. Click **OK**.
9. In the **Settings** tab, select **Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed**.
9. Click **OK**.



## Provide link to test

Anything hosted on the web can be presented in a locked down manner, not just assessments. To lock down online content, just embed a URL with a specific prefix and devices will be locked down when users follow the link. We recommend using this method for lower stakes assessments. 

1. Create a link to the test URL. Use **ms-edu-secureassessment:** before the URL and **!enforceLockdown** after the URL.
``` 
ms-edu-secureassessment:<URL>!enforceLockdown
 ```
 > 
            **Note**:   You may want to remove !enforceLockdown for tests that utilizes our lockdown API that checks for running processes before locking down. Removing !enforceLockdown will result in the app not locking down immediately which allows you to close apps that are not allowed to run during lockdown. The test web application may lock down the device once you have closed the apps. 

2. Distribute the link. You can use the web, email, OneNote, or any other method of your choosing.
3. To take the test, the student clicks on the link and provides user consent.



## Assessment URLs

This assessment URL uses our lockdown API:

- SBAC/AIR:  [http://mobile.tds.airast.org/launchpad/](http://mobile.tds.airast.org/launchpad/).
