As a result, the user might not be able to access network resources or save work.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nShut down the MED-V guest and restart it.\n\n### URL Redirection\n\n### Event ID 5005\n\nCouldn’t get VM name from configuration; can’t launch guest browser.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nURL Redirection could not obtain the MED-V workspace name from the configuration. As a result, it cannot inform Windows Virtual PC to open the redirected URL in the MED-V workspace browser.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nEnsure that the MED-V workspace name is set and that it matches a virtual machine name in the C:\\\\Users\\\\&lt;*user*&gt;\\\\Virtual Machines directory. The MED-V workspace name is located at HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Medv\\\\v2\\\\VM\\\\Name.\n\nFor example, if the user is \"Matt\" and the workspace name is \"mattsworkspace\", the value of HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Medv\\\\v2\\\\VM\\\\Name should be \"mattsworkspace\", and there should be a file that is named C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\Virtual Machines\\\\mattsworkspace.vcmx.\n\n### Event ID 5006\n\nFailed to create pipe server.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nThe URL Redirection service could not create the pipe server to communicate with Internet Explorer.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nCheck system event logs for attempts to create a file or resource whose path begins similar to the following: \"\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\MEDVUrlRedirectionPipe\\_\" and ends with the user’s user name and domain name. If this is not present in the event log, restart the computer.\n\n### ConfigMgr (Guest)\n\n### Event ID 7001\n\nThe host network configuration data is not properly formatted.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nEither the network configuration received from the host is an incorrectly formatted XML string, or the network information returned from the host cannot be written to an XML document.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nRestart the host computer and the virtual machine.\n\n### Event ID 7005\n\nA change to the host network configuration was detected, but was not able to be applied because the host network configuration data was not properly formatted.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nA change to the host network configuration was communicated to the virtual machine, but could not be processed in the virtual machine because of an error. This error could be caused by incorrectly formatted data or the inability to set the information into the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) CCMNetworkAdapter instance.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nRestart the host and virtual machine.\n\n### ConfigMgr (Host)\n\n### Event ID 8006\n\nThe virtual machine cannot be found.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nWindows Virtual PC 7 cannot locate the virtual machine. The virtual machine might have been deleted, moved, removed, or access was denied.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nReinstall the virtual machine.\n\n### Event ID 8008\n\nThe workstation's network configuration information could not be retrieved.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nNetwork configuration information could not be collected from the MED-V host, most likely because of a system call failure in the .NET Framework. This failure can also occur if the network information returned from the MED-V host cannot be written to an XML document.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nRestart the host workstation.\n\n### Event ID 8010\n\nThe network configuration data could not be set in the virtual machine.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nThe MED-V host network address translation (NAT) could not be communicated to the virtual machine, most likely because the virtual machine is in a bad state or the Windows Virtual PC Additions were not installed or enabled.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nShut down and restart the virtual machine. In addition, you might have to reinstall the virtual machine.\n\n### Event ID 8011\n\nThe network configuration data could not be reset in the virtual machine.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nThe MED-V host network configuration (BRIDGED) could not be communicated to the virtual machine, most likely because the virtual machine is in a bad state or the Windows Virtual PC Additions were not installed or enabled.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nShut down and restart the virtual machine.

For example, if the user is \"Matt\", the path C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\AppData\\\\, and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions. And if it exists, the path C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\MEDV\\\\v2\\\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions.\n\n### Event ID 9002\n\nFile Permission Error.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nThe end user is not authorized to access the folder required to open or create the MED-V printer file for writing.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nEnsure that the User\\\\AppData\\\\ path can be accessed, and that the user has permission to read and write to it. For example, if the user is \"Matt\", the path C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\AppData\\\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions. And if it exists, the path C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\MEDV\\\\v2\\\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions.\n\n### Event ID 9004\n\nCould not create path for storing MEDV printer files.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nThe printer redirection service could not access files or create directories required for storing the printer information.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nVerify that the User\\\\AppData\\\\ path can be accessed and that the user has permission to read and write to it. For example, if the user is \"Matt\", the path C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\AppData\\\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions. And if it exists, the path C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\MEDV\\\\v2\\\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions.\n\n### Event ID 9005\n\nCouldn’t get VM name from configuration; cannot launch guest installer. Cannot update MED-V – No host network detected.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nThe printer redirection service was not able to obtain the MED-V workspace name from the MED-V configuration and cannot inform Windows Virtual PC to start the installer on the MED-V guest.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nEnsure that the MED-V workspace name is set and that it matches a virtual machine name in the C:\\\\Users\\\\&lt;*user*&gt;\\\\Virtual Machines directory. The MED-V workspace name is located at HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Medv\\\\v2\\\\VM\\\\Name.\n\nFor example, if the user is \"Matt\" and the workspace name is \"mattsworkspace\", the value of HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Medv\\\\v2\\\\VM\\\\Name should be \"mattsworkspace\" and there should be a file that is named C:\\\\Users\\\\Matt\\\\Virtual Machines\\\\mattsworkspace.vcmx.\n\n### Application Publishing\n\n### Event ID 10015\n\nA file system error occurred during the reconcile process. The reconcile process will not process the file &lt;*filename*&gt; but will continue to process any other changes.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nAn unauthorized access or I/O error occurred when a shortcut was being created or deleted.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nCheck that the file path can be accessed and that the user has permissions to create or delete the specified file.\n\n### Event ID 10021\n\nError &lt;*error\\_information*&gt; for file operation &lt;*operation\\_name*&gt; on file &lt;*filename*&gt;.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nAn unauthorized access or I/O error occurred when a shortcut was being created or deleted.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nCheck that the file path can be accessed and that the user has permissions to create or delete the specified file.\n\n### Guest Patching\n\n### Event ID 11001\n\nGuest wakeup task usage message.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nMedvHost.exe with the /GuestWakeup option was executed incorrectly, or the command is formatted incorrectly.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nEnsure that the command is executed with the following format:\n\nMedvhost.exe /GuestWakeup /d:&lt; *duration\\_in\\_minutes*&gt; /v:”&lt; *workspace\\_name*&gt;” where\n\n&lt;*duration\\_in\\_minutes*&gt; is the number of minutes that the virtual machine should stay awake (default is 240) and\n\n&lt;*workspace\\_name*&gt; is the name of the virtual machine that should be awakened.\n\n### Event ID 11002\n\nCannot update MED-V – No host network detected.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nGuest patching could not finish because no host network connection was detected.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nConnect the MED-V host to an active network connection before you run guest patching.\n\n### Event ID 11003\n\nCannot update MED-V – Host not running on A/C powerFailed to create pipe server.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nGuest patching could not finish because the host appears to be running on battery power instead of from a power cord.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"solution\"></a>**Solution**  \nConnect the host computer to a power cord before you run guest patching.\n\n### Client UX\n\n### Event ID 14003\n\nThe following tray status message was too long and could not be displayed: &lt;*tray\\_status\\_message*&gt;\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"description\"></a>**Description**  \nMED-V created an unanticipated string that was too long for the tray tooltip or balloon message.
