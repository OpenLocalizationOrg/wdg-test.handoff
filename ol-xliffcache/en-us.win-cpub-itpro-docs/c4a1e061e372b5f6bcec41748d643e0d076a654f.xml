If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the account that requested the new logon session with explicit credentials.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name.

Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):\n\n    <img src=\"images/task-manager.png\" alt=\"Task manager illustration\" width=\"585\" height=\"375\" />\n\n    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.\n\n    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\\\New Process ID**.\n\n-   **Process Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.\n\n**Network Information:**\n\n-   **Network Address** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** IP address of machine from which logon attempt was performed.\n\n    -   IPv6 address or ::ffff:IPv4 address of a client.\n\n    -   ::1 or 127.0.0.1 means localhost.\n\n-   **Port** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: source port which was used for logon attempt from remote machine.\n\n    -   0 for interactive logons.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4648(S): A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.\n\nThe following table is similar to the table in [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md), but also describes ways of monitoring that use “**Account Whose Credentials Were Used\\\\Security ID.**”\n\n| **Type of monitoring required**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Recommendation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **High-value accounts**: You might have high value domain or local accounts for which you need to monitor each action.<br>Examples of high value accounts are database administrators, built-in local administrator account, domain administrators, service accounts, domain controller accounts and so on. | Monitor this event with the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** or “**Account Whose Credentials Were Used\\\\Security ID**” that correspond to the high value account or accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **Anomalies or malicious actions**: You might have specific requirements for detecting anomalies or monitoring potential malicious actions.
