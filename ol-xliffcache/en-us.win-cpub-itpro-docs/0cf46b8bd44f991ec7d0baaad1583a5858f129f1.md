**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows Server 2008 R2

The Microsoft Compatibility Exchange propagates data of various types between Microsoft Corporation, independent software vendors (ISVs) and the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) Community.

## Data Sent to Microsoft


During synchronization, the Microsoft Compatibility Exchange sends the following information to Microsoft Corporation:

-   
            **Application information and properties**. This data includes the application name, the vendor, the version number, the language, and the deployment type.

The data-synchronization process does not send your list of URLs visited as part of the information exchange.

## Data Sent to the ACT Community


The Microsoft Compatibility Exchange sends the following information to the ACT Community for each application that you decide to share with the ACT Community:

-   
            **Application information and properties**. This data includes the application name, the vendor, the version number, the language, and the deployment type.

-   
            **Miscellaneous data**. This data includes:

    -   The database GUID that identifies the organization that is the source of the data.

    -   The issue data.

    -   The issue ID.

    -   The platform and destination operating system.

    -   The severity.

    -   The cause.

    -   The symptom.

    -   The solution data.

    -   The solution type.

    -   The issue and solution provider.

    -   The issue and solution subprovider.

    -   The issue and solution published date.

    -   Your risk assessment.

The data-synchronization process does not send your list of URLs visited as part of the information exchange.

## Data Matching


After you send your data, the Microsoft Compatibility Exchange matches your application properties against the known issues listed in the Application Profile database. The Microsoft Compatibility Exchange downloads any issues and corresponding solutions that match your application set and then stores the information in your ACT database.

## Data Sent From Microsoft and ISVs


For each application that matches an application in the Application Profile database, the Microsoft Compatibility Exchange returns the following information, provided by authoritative sources including Microsoft Corporation and independent software vendors (ISVs).
