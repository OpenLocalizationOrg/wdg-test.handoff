After the appropriate settings have been configured, the computer running the App-V 5.0 client will automatically collect data and will send the data back to the reporting server.\n\n    Additionally, administrators can manually send the data back in an on-demand manner using the **Send-AppvClientReport** PowerShell cmdlet.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
