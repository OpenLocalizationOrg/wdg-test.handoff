# How to Create an Application License Group


The Application Virtualization Server Management Console enables you to organize and manage application licenses. Depending on the type of license group, you can control who has access to the application and how many users can access an application at a time. You can use the following procedure to create an application license group.

**To create an application license group**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, right-click the **Application Licenses** node.

2.  Select one of the following menu items that corresponds to the type of license group you want to create, and complete the pages in the associated **New License Wizard**:

    1.  **New Unlimited License**

    2.  **New Concurrent License**

    3.  **New Named License**

3.  Click **Finish**.
