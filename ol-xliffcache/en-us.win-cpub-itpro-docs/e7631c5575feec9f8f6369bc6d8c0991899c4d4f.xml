The key to the process is taking an accurate inventory of your organization's applications, which requires investigation of all the targeted business groups. With an accurate inventory, you can create rules and set enforcement criteria that will allow the organization to use the required applications and allow the IT department to manage a controlled set of applications.\n\nThe following diagram shows the main points in the design, planning, and deployment process for AppLocker.\n\n![applocker quick reference guide](images/applocker-plandeploy-quickreference.gif)\n\n## Resources to support the deployment process\n\nThe following topics contain information about designing, planning, deploying, and maintaining AppLocker policies:\n\n-   For info about the AppLocker policy design and planning requirements and process, see [AppLocker Design Guide](applocker-policies-design-guide.md).\n-   For info about the AppLocker policy deployment requirements and process, see [AppLocker deployment guide](applocker-policies-deployment-guide.md).\n-   For info about AppLocker policy maintenance and monitoring, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md).\n-   For info about AppLocker policy architecture, components, and processing, see [AppLocker technical reference](applocker-technical-reference.md).\n \n \n"}
