Depending on the type of license group, you control who has access to the application and how many users can access an application at a time. You can also access license compliance reports for the application.\n\n**Important**  \nOne or more application license groups must exist for you to associate an application with a license group.\n\n \n\n**To associate an application with a license group**\n\n1.  In the left pane of the management console, expand the **Applications** node.\n\n2.  Right-click the application you want to add to a license group, and choose **Properties**.\n\n3.  On the **General** tab, use the **Application License Group** pull-down menu to choose the group.\n\n4.
