# Deleting or Restoring a GPO


To use Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) to delete a Group Policy Object (GPO) from the archive or restore a deleted GPO from the Recycle Bin, the GPO must be controlled by AGPM. As an Editor, you may not have permission to complete the deletion or restoration of a GPO, but you do have the permission necessary to begin the process and submit your request to an Approver.
