**Checklist: Implementing certificate-based authentication**

| Task | Reference |
| - | - |
| Review important concepts and examples for certificate-based authentication to determine if this design meets your deployment goals and the needs of your organization.| [Identifying Your Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Deployment Goals](identifying-your-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-deployment-goals.md)<br/>[Certificate-based Isolation Policy Design](certificate-based-isolation-policy-design.md)<br/>[Certificate-based Isolation Policy Design Example](certificate-based-isolation-policy-design-example.md)<br/>[Planning Certificate-based Authentication](planning-certificate-based-authentication.md) |
| Install the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) role as an enterprise root issuing certification authority (CA). This step is required only if you have not already deployed a CA on your network.| |
| Configure the certificate template for workstation authentication certificates.| [Configure the Workstation Authentication Certificate Template](configure-the-workstation-authentication-certificate-template.md)| 
| Configure Group Policy to automatically deploy certificates based on your template to workstation devices. | [Configure Group Policy to Autoenroll and Deploy Certificates](configure-group-policy-to-autoenroll-and-deploy-certificates.md)| 
| On a test device, refresh Group Policy and confirm that the certificate is installed. | [Confirm That Certificates Are Deployed Correctly](confirm-that-certificates-are-deployed-correctly.md)|
