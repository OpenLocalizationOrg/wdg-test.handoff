Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To set the default template for use when creating new GPOs**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click the **Templates** tab to display available templates.\n\n3.  Right-click the template that you want to set as the default, and then click **Set as Default**.\n\n4.  Click **Yes** to confirm.\n\n5.  When the **Progress** window indicates that overall progress is complete, click **Close**. The default template has a blue icon and the state is identified as **Template (default)** on the **Templates** tab.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Editor or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Create Template** permissions for the domain.\n\n-   After you set a template as the default, that template will be the one initially selected in the **New Controlled GPO** dialog box when Group Policy administrators create new GPOs. However, they will have the option to select any other GPO template, including **&lt;Empty GPO&gt;**, which does not include any settings.\n\n-   Renaming or deleting a template does not impact GPOs created from that template.\n\n-   Because it cannot be altered, a template does not have a history.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Creating a Template and Setting a Default Template](creating-a-template-and-setting-a-default-template-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Request the Creation of a New Controlled GPO](request-the-creation-of-a-new-controlled-gpo-agpm40.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
