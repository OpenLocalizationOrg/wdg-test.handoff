UE-V also allows administrators to create custom settings location templates for other applications, including third-party or line-of-business applications that are used in the enterprise. This topic includes a list of applications that are included with the UE-V client and guidance on how to include custom settings location templates.\n\n[Planning Which Applications to Synchronize with UE-V 1.0](planning-which-applications-to-synchronize-with-ue-v-10.md)\n\n## Checklist for Evaluating Line-of-Business Applications for UE-V\n\n\nGuidance on whether a line-of-business application should be synchronized.\n\n[Checklist for Evaluating Line-of-Business Applications for UE-V 1.0](checklist-for-evaluating-line-of-business-applications-for-ue-v-10.md)\n\n## Plan custom template deployment\n\n\nIn order to support other applications, including third-party applications, you must create custom settings location templates by using the UE-V Generator, and deploy them to a settings template catalog.\n\n[Planning for Custom Template Deployment for UE-V 1.0](planning-for-custom-template-deployment-for-ue-v-10.md)\n\n## Plan for UE-V configuration\n\n\nUE-V configurations determine how settings are synchronized throughout the enterprise. These configurations can be made before, during, or after the UE-V Agent is deployed.
