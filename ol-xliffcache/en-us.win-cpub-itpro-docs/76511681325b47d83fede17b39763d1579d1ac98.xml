Before you install the database scripts, review and keep a copy of the App-V license terms. By running the database scripts, you are agreeing to the license terms. If you do not accept them, you should not use this software.\n\n2.  Copy the **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** from the App-V release media to a temporary location.\n\n3.  From a command prompt, run **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** and specify a temporary location for extracting the database scripts.\n\n    Example: appv\\_server\\_setup.exe /layout c:\\\\&lt;temporary location path&gt;\n\n4.  Browse to the temporary location that you created, open the extracted **DatabaseScripts** folder, and review the appropriate Readme.txt file for instructions:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Database</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Location of Readme.txt file to use</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Management database</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>ManagementDatabase subfolder</p>\n    <div class=\"alert\">\n    <strong>Important</strong>  \n    <p>If you are upgrading to or installing the App-V 5.0 SP3 Management database, see [SQL scripts to install or upgrade the App-V 5.0 SP3 Management Server database fail](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3031340).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n     \n    </div></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Reporting database</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>ReportingDatabase subfolder</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
