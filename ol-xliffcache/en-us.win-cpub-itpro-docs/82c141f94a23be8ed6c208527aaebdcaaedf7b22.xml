values and security considerations for the **Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos Win7 only** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting allows you to set the encryption types that the Kerberos protocol is allowed to use. If it is not selected, the encryption type will not be allowed. This setting might affect compatibility with client computers or services and applications. Multiple selections are permitted.\n\nFor more information, see [article 977321](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977321) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.\n\nThe following table lists and explains the allowed encryption types.\n\n| Encryption type | Description and version support |\n| - | - |\n| DES_CBC_CRC | Data Encryption Standard with Cipher Block Chaining using the Cyclic Redundancy Check function<br/>Supported in Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.

To enable Kerberos interoperability with non-Windows versions of the Kerberos protocol, these suites can be enabled. However, doing so might open attack vectors on computers running \nWindows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. You can also disable DES for your computers running Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nDo not configure this policy. This will force the computers running Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 to use the AES or RC4 cryptographic suites.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nIf you do not select any of the encryption types, computers running Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 might have Kerberos authentication failures when connecting with computers running non-Windows versions of the Kerberos protocol.\n\nIf you do select any encryption type, you will lower the effectiveness of encryption for Kerberos authentication but you will improve interoperability with computers running older versions of Windows.\nContemporary non-Windows implementations of the Kerberos protocol support RC4 and AES 128-bit and AES 256-bit encryption. Most implementations, including the MIT Kerberos protocol and the Windows Kerberos protocol, are deprecating DES encryption.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
