2012\n-   Windows Server 2008 R2\n\nThe goal of the test environment is to model the operating system that you want to deploy and assess compatibility before deploying the operating system to your production environment. Your test environment is composed of computers on which the new operating system is installed. Your test environment can be a long-term investment. Consider retaining the test environment after deployment to assist in future deployment projects.\n\n## Modeling the Production Environment\n\n\nWe recommend the following practices for setting up your test environment:\n\n-   Physically separate your test environment from your production environment. Physical separation helps ensure that activity in the test environment does not affect the production environment.\n\n-   On the computers in your test environment, install the new operating system.\n\n-   Perform all of your tests by using accounts that have similar permissions to the accounts in your production environment. This approach helps to ensure that you can determine potential security issues.\n\n## Configuring the Test Environment for Automated Testing\n\n\nTypically, tests are run more than once, which requires being able to revert your test environment to a previous state. We recommend the following practices to ensure consistency in testing and consistency in restoring the state of your test environment:\n\n-   Use disk-imaging software to create physical disk images.\n\n-   Use software virtualization features to reverse changes to virtualized hard disks.\n\n## Determining When Virtualization Is Appropriate\n\n\nThe following table shows some of the advantages and disadvantages of virtualization.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Advantages</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Disadvantages</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><ul>\n<li><p>Supports a large number of servers in a limited amount of physical space.
