Device Guard signing\n\n\n**Applies to**\n\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows 10 Mobile\n\nDevice Guard signing is a Device Guard feature that is available in the Windows Store for Business. It gives admins a single place to sign catalog files and code integrity policies. After admins have created catalog files for unsigned apps and signed the catalog files, they can add the signers to a code integrity policy. You can merge the code integrity policy with your existing policy to include your custom signing certificate. This allows you to trust the catalog files.\n\nDevice Guard is a feature set that consists of both hardware and software system integrity hardening features. These features use new virtualization-based security options and the trust-nothing mobile device operating system model. A key feature in this model is called configurable code integrity, which allows your organization to choose exactly which software or trusted software publishers are allowed to run code on your client machines. Also, Device Guard offers organizations a way to sign existing line-of-business (LOB) applications so that they can trust their own code, without the requirement that the application be repackaged. Also, this same method of signing allows organizations to trust individual third-party applications.
