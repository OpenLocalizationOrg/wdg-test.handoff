# 5069(S, F): A cryptographic function property operation was attempted.

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


This event generates in [BCryptSetContextFunctionProperty](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/Aa375501(v=VS.85).aspx)() function. This is a Cryptographic Next Generation (CNG) function.

This event generates when named property for a cryptographic function in an existing CNG context was added or removed.
