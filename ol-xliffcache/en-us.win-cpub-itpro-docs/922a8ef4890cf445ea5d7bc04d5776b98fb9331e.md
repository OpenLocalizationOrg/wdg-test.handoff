# Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14332 or later
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) is a security service, built into Windows 10 that enables enterprise customers detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats on their networks.

Windows Defender ATP uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

-   
                **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system (for example, process, registry, file, and network communications) and sends this telemetry to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Windows Defender ATP.


-   
                **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem (such as the [Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx), enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets (such as Bing and SmartScreen URL reputation), behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.

-   
                **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Windows Defender ATP to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these are observed in collected telemetry.

The following diagram shows these Windows Defender ATP service components:

Endpoint investigation capabilities in this service let you drill down into security alerts and understand the scope and nature of a potential breach. You can submit files for deep analysis and receive the results without leaving the [Windows Defender ATP portal](https://securitycenter.windows.com).

Windows Defender ATP works with existing Windows security technologies on endpoints, such as Windows Defender, AppLocker, and Device Guard. It can also work side-by-side with third-party security solutions and antimalware products.

Windows Defender ATP leverages Microsoft technology and expertise to detect sophisticated cyber-attacks, providing:

- Behavior-based, cloud-powered, advanced attack detection

    Finds the attacks that made it past all other defenses (post breach detection),provides actionable, correlated alerts for known and unknown adversaries trying to hide their activities on endpoints.

- Rich timeline for forensic investigation and mitigation

    Easily investigate the scope of breach or suspected behaviors on any machine through a rich machine timeline. File, URLs, and network connection inventory across the network. Gain additional insight using deep collection and analysis (“detonation”) for any file or URLs.

- Built in unique threat intelligence knowledge base

    Unparalleled threat optics provides actor details and intent context for every threat intel-based detection – combining first and third-party intelligence sources.
