On the computer that is running the Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer, to open the command prompt, select **Start**, **Run**, and type **cmd**. Click **OK**.\n\n2.  At the command prompt, specify the location where the App-V Sequencer is installed. For example, at the command prompt, you could type the following: **cd C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer**.\n\n3.  At the command prompt, type the following command, replacing the text in quotation marks with your values:\n\n    `SFTSequencer /UPGRADE:“pathtosourceSPRJ” /INSTALLPACKAGE:“pathtoUpgradeInstaller” /DECODEPATH:”pathtodecodefolder” /OUTPUTFILE:“pathtodestinationSPRJ”`\n\n    **Note**  \n    You can specify additional parameters by using the command line, depending on the complexity of the application you are upgrading. For a complete list of parameters that are available for use with the App-V Sequencer, see [Sequencer Command-Line Parameters](sequencer-command-line-parameters.md).\n\n     \n\n    Use the value descriptions in the following table to help you determine the actual text you will use in the preceding command.\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><em>pathtosourceSPRJ</em></p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Specifies the directory location of the virtual application to be upgraded.</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><em>pathtoUpgradeInstaller</em></p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Specifies the Windows Installer or a batch file that will be used to install an upgrade to the application.</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><em>pathtodecodefolder</em></p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Specify the directory in which to unpack the SFT file.</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p><em>pathtodestinationSPRJ</em></p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Specifies the path and file name of the SPRJ file that will be created.</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n4.
