Manually\n\n\nYou can use the Application Virtualization (App-V) Client Management Console to manage virtual applications in the App-V Desktop Client or the App-V Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services). App-V administrators can use perform the following tasks:\n\n## How to Load or Unload an App-V Application\n\n\nYou can use the following procedures to load or unload an application from the cache, directly from the **Results** pane of the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console. When you select this node, the **Results** pane displays a list of applications.\n\n**Note**  \nWhen you load or unload a package, all the applications in the package are loaded into or removed from cache. When loading a package, if you do not have adequate space in cache to load the applications, increase your cache size. For more information about cache size, see [How to Change the Cache Size and the Drive Letter Designation](how-to-change-the-cache-size-and-the-drive-letter-designation.md).\n\n \n\n**To load an App-V application**\n\n1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Load** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  The application is automatically loaded. The progress is tracked in the column labeled **Package Status**. You must refresh the view to see that the load is complete or to see the progress.\n\n**To unload an App-V application**\n\n1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Unload** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  The application is automatically unloaded, and the **Package Status** column is updated to reflect the change.\n\n## How to clear an App-V application\n\n\nYou can clear an application from the console directly from the **Results** pane of the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console. When you clear an application, the system removes the settings, shortcuts, and file type associations that correspond to the application and also removes the application from the userâ€™s list of applications.\n\n**Note**  \nWhen you clear an application from the console, you can no longer use that application. However, the application remains in cache and is still available to other users on the same system. After a publishing refresh, the cleared applications will again become available to you. If there are multiple applications in a package, the user's settings are not removed until all of the applications are cleared.\n\n \n\n**To clear an application from the console**\n\n1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Clear** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  At the confirmation prompt, click **Yes** to remove the application or click **No** to cancel the operation.\n\n## How to Repair an App-V application\n\n\nTo repair a selected application, you can perform the following procedure directly from the **Results** pane of the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console. When you repair an application, you remove any custom user settings and restore the default settings. This action does not change or delete shortcuts or file type associations, and it does not remove the application from cache.\n\n**To repair an App-V application**\n\n1.
