This includes the hardware requirements for installing DaRT 10. For more information about DaRT hardware and software requirements, see [DaRT 10 Supported Configurations](dart-10-supported-configurations.md).\n\nThe topics in this section can be used to help you deploy DaRT in your enterprise based on your environment and deployment strategy.\n\n## Deploy DaRT 10\n\n\nYou can use the Windows Installer file for DaRT to install DaRT on a computer that you will use to first create the DaRT recovery image and then troubleshoot and fix end-user computers. Frequently, across an organization, you might install on the administrator computer only the DaRT functionality that you need to create a DaRT recovery image. Then, on a help desk administrator’s computer, you might install only the DaRT functionality that you must have to troubleshoot a problem computer, such as the DaRT Remote Connection Viewer and the Crash Analyzer.\n\nIn addition to manually running the Windows Installer file to install DaRT, you can also install DaRT at the command prompt to support enterprise software deployment systems such as System Center Configuration Manager 2012.\n\n[How to Deploy DaRT 10](how-to-deploy-dart-10.md)\n\n## Change, repair, or remove DaRT 10\n\n\nYou can change, repair, or remove the DaRT installation by double-clicking the DaRT installation file and then clicking the button that corresponds to the action that you want to perform or through the Windows Control Panel.\n\n[How to Change, Repair, or Remove DaRT 10](how-to-change-repair-or-remove-dart-10.md)\n\n## How to get DaRT 10\n\n\nTo get the DaRT software, see [How to Get MDOP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=322049).\n\n## Other resources for deploying DaRT 10 to administrator computers\n\n\n[Deploying DaRT 10](deploying-dart-10.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
