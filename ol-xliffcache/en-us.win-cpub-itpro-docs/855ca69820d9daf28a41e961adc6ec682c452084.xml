If you enable this setting, the built-in Administrator account is automatically logged on to the computer at the Recovery Console; no password is required.\n\nThe Recovery Console can be very useful when troubleshooting and repairing systems that cannot be restarted. However, enabling this policy setting so a user can automatically log on to the console is dangerous. Anyone can walk up to the server, shut it down by disconnecting the power, reboot it, select **Recovery Console** from the **Restart** menu, and then assume full control of the server.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n\n    The built-in Administrator account is automatically logged on to the computer at the Recovery Console; no password is required\n\n-   Disabled\n\n    Automatic administrative logon is not allowed.\n\n-   Not defined\n\n    Automatic administrative logon is not allowed.\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set **Recovery Console: Allow automatic administrative logon** to **Disabled**. This requires a user to enter a user name and password to access the Recovery Console account.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy| Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nSetting and deploying this policy using Group Policy takes precedence over the setting on the local device\n\n### Policy conflicts\n\nNone.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nThe Recovery Console can be very useful when you must troubleshoot and repair device that do not start. However, allowing automatic logon to the Recovery Console can make it possible for someone to assume full control of the server.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nDisable the **Recovery console: Allow automatic administrative logon** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nUsers must enter a user name and password to access the Recovery Console.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
