# Windows Defender in Windows 10

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

Windows Defender in Windows 10 is a built-in antimalware solution that provides security and antimalware management for desktops, portable computers, and servers.
This topic provides an overview of Windows Defender, including a list of system requirements and new features.

For more important information about running Windows Defender on a server platform, see [Windows Defender Overview for Windows Server Technical Preview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn765478.aspx).

Take advantage of Windows Defender by configuring the settings and definitions using the following tools:
-   Microsoft Active Directory *Group Policy* for settings
-   Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for definitions

Windows Defender provides the most protection when cloud-based protection is enabled. Learn how to enable cloud-based protection in [Configure Windows Defender in Windows 10](configure-windows-defender-in-windows-10.md).
> 
            **Note:**  System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager SP1, System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP2, and Microsoft Intune can provide centralized management of Windows Defender, including:
-   Settings management
-   Definition update management
-   Alerts and alert management
-   Reports and report management

When you enable endpoint protection for your clients, it will install an additional management layer on Windows Defender to manage the in-box Windows Defender agent. While the client user interface will still appear as Windows Defender, the management layer for Endpoint Protection will be listed in the **Add/Remove Programs** control panel, though it will appear as if the full product is installed.
 
### Minimum system requirements

Windows Defender has the same hardware requirements as Windows 10. For more information, see:
-   [Minimum hardware requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915086.aspx)
-   [Hardware component guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915049.aspx)

### New and changed functionality

-   **Improved detection for unwanted applications and emerging threats using cloud-based protection.** Use the Microsoft Active Protection Service to improve protection against unwanted applications and advanced persistent threats in your enterprise.
-   **Windows 10 integration.** All Windows Defender in Windows 10 endpoints will show the Windows Defender user interface, even when the endpoint is managed.
-   **Operating system, enterprise-level management, and bring your own device (BYOD) integration.** Windows 10 introduces a mobile device management (MDM) interface for devices running Windows 10. Administrators can use MDM-capable products, such as Intune, to manage Windows Defender on Windows 10 devices.

For more information about what's new in Windows Defender in Windows 10, see [Windows Defender in Windows 10: System integration](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/enterprise/threatreports_august_2015.aspx) on the Microsoft Active Protection Service website.
