# How to Determine BitLocker Encryption State of Lost Computers


You can use Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) to determine the last known BitLocker encryption status of computers that were lost or stolen. The following procedure explains how to determine whether the volumes on a computer are encrypted if there is a loss or theft.

**To determine the last known BitLocker encryption state of lost computers**

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the Administration and Monitoring website.

    **Note**  
    Note: The default address for the Administration and Monitoring website is http://*&lt;computername&gt;*. Using the fully qualified server name will yield faster browsing results.

     

2.  Selects the **Report** node from the navigation pane, and select the **Computer Compliance Report**.

3.  Use the filter fields in the right pane to narrow the search results, and then click **Search**. Results are shown below your search query.

4.  Take the appropriate action, as determined by your policy for lost devices.

    **Note**  
    Device compliance is determined by the BitLocker policies that your enterprise has deployed. You may want to verify your deployed policies before you try to determine the BitLocker encryption state of a device.
