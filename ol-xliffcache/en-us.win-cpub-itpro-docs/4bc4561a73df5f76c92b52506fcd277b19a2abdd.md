**Note**  
The version numbers for ACT 6.1 Update and Update 2 are identical, so you will need to look at the product ID of ACT to tell them apart. To find the product ID, open ACT, go to **Help**&gt;**About**, and compare the product ID to the following list.

-   
            **ACT 6.1 Update**: B264FCCB-3F1F-828F-CCF8-EDB93E860970

-   
            **ACT 6.1 Update 2**: B2BC4686-29A9-9E9D-F2E4-7E20659EECE7

If you run into any of the bugs fixed in Update 2, you likely have ACT 6.1 Update or older. Please download the latest version in the Windows ADK.
