The Directory Replication Agent uses the connection objects in the topology map to find out those partners that are relevant when replicating changes to directory partitions.

Each domain controller stores a copy of a specific part of the directory tree, called a **Naming Context** also known as Directory Partition. **Naming Context** is replicated as a unit to other domain controllers in the forest that contain a replica of the same sub tree. A **Naming Context** is also called a Directory Partition.\n\n-   **Options** \\[Type = UInt32\\]: decimal value of [DRS Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc228477.aspx).\n\n    <img src=\"images/ad-sites-and-services.png\" alt=\"Directory Replication Service options in AD Sites and Services\" width=\"890\" height=\"529\" />\n\n-   **Status Code** \\[Type = UInt32\\]**:** if there are no issues or errors, the status code will be 0.
