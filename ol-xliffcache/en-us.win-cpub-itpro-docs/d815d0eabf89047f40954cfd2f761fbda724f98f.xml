To create the .sft file by using the command line, enter the following at a command prompt:\n\n**mkdiffpkg.exe &lt;base SFT file name&gt; &lt;diff SFT file name&gt;**\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"file-name-in-osd-file-is-not-correct-after-package-upgrade-\"></a>File Name in OSD File Is Not Correct After Package Upgrade\n\n\nWhen you open a package for upgrade, you should specify the root Q:\\\\ drive as the output location for the package. Do not specify an associated file name with the output location.\n\n## Microsoft Word 2003 Default Install Results in an Error When Streamed to a Client\n\n\nWhen you stream Microsoft Word 2003 to a client, an error is returned, but Microsoft Word continues to run.\n\n**Solution**\n\nResequence the virtual application package and select **Full Install**.\n\n## Active Upgrade Does Not Work When You Create a Dependent Package\n\n\nWhen you create a dependent package by using active upgrade and add new registry entries, it appears to function correctly, but the updated registry entries are not available.\n\n**Solution**\n\nRegistry settings are always stored with the original version of the package, so updates to the package will not appear to be available unless you repair the original package.\n\n## Detailed information is not visible for Microsoft Office 2007 documents by using the properties page\n\n\nWhen you try to view detailed information associated with a Microsoft Office 2007 document by using the properties page, the detailed information is not visible.\n\n**Solution**\n\nApp-V does not support the required shell extensions for these property pages.\n\n## Some registry keys are not captured when you sequence 16-bit applications\n\n\nIn App-V 4.5, registry hooking has been moved from kernel mode to user mode. If you want to sequence a 16-bit application or an application that uses a 16-bit installer, you must first configure the sequencer computer so that the process runs in its own copy of the Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM).\n\n**Solution**\n\nBefore you sequence the application, set the following global REGSZ registry key value to \"yes\" on the sequencing computer:\n\nHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\WOW\\\\DefaultSeparateVDM\n\nYou must restart the computer before this takes effect.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Sequencer](application-virtualization-sequencer.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
