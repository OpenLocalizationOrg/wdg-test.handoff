# Create packages for multiple operating systems or languages
You'll create multiple versions of your custom browser package if:

-   You support more than 1 version of WindowsÂ®.

-   You support more than 1 language.

-   You have custom installation packages with only minor differences. Like, having a different phone number.

 ![](images/wedge.gif) **To create a new package**

1.  Create an installation package using the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11, as described in the [Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) Customization Wizard options](../ie11-ieak/ieak11-wizard-custom-options.md) topic.

2.  Go to your **CIE/Custom** folder and rename the `Install.ins`file. For example, if you need a version for employees in Texas, rename the file to Texas.ins.

3.  Run the wizard again, using the Custom folder as the destination directory.<p>
**Important**<br>
Except for the **Title bar** text, **Favorites**, **Links bar**, **Home page**, and **Search bar**, keep all of your wizard settings the same for all of your build computers.
