# 5155(F): The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked an application or service from listening on a port for incoming connections.

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


By default Windows firewall won't prevent a port from being listened by an application. In the other word, Windows system will not generate Event 5155 by itself.

You can add your own filters using the WFP APIs to block listen to reproduce this event: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364046(v=vs.85).aspx>.

There is no event example in this document.
