# Microsoft Surface Data Eraser


Find out how the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser tool can help you securely wipe data from your Surface devices.


            [Microsoft Surface Data Eraser](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=691148) is a tool that boots from a USB stick and allows you to perform a secure wipe of all data from a compatible Surface device. A Microsoft Surface Data Eraser USB stick requires only the ability to boot from USB. The USB tool is easy to create by using the provided wizard, the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser Wrapper, and is easy to use with a simple graphic interface, no command line needed. To learn more about the data wiping capabilities and practices Microsoft uses during the service process for Surface, see [Protecting your data if you send your Surface in for service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=691222).

Compatible Surface devices include:

-   Surface Book

-   Surface Pro 4

-   Surface Pro3

-   Surface 3

-   Surface 3 LTE

-   Surface Pro 2

Some scenarios where Microsoft Surface Data Eraser can be helpful include:

-   Prepare a Surface device to be sent for repair

-   Decommission a Surface device to be removed from corporate or organizational use

-   Repurpose a Surface device for use in a new department or for use by a new user

-   Standard practice when performing reimaging for devices used with sensitive data

>
            **Note:**            &nbsp;&nbsp;Third-party devices, Surface devices running Windows RT (including Surface and Surface 2), and Surface Pro are not compatible with Microsoft Surface Data Eraser.

>
            **Note:**            &nbsp;&nbsp;Because the ability to boot to USB is required to run Microsoft Surface Data Eraser, if the device is not configured to boot from USB or if the device is unable to boot or POST successfully, the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser tool will not function.


## How to create a Microsoft Surface Data Eraser USB stick


To create a Microsoft Surface Data Eraser USB stick, first install the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser setup tool from the Microsoft Download Center using the link provided at the beginning of this article. You do not need a Surface device to *create* the USB stick. After you have downloaded the installation file to your computer, follow these steps to install the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser creation tool:

1.  Run the DataEraserSetup.msi installation file that you downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center.

2.  Select the check box to accept the terms of the license agreement, and then click **Install**.

3.  Click **Finish** to close the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser setup window.

After the creation tool is installed, follow these steps to create a Microsoft Surface Data Eraser USB stick. Before you begin these steps, ensure that you have a USB 3.0 stick that is 4 GB or larger connected to the computer.

1.  Start Microsoft Surface Data Eraser from the Start menu or Start screen.

2.  Click **Build** to begin the Microsoft Surface Data Eraser USB creation process.
