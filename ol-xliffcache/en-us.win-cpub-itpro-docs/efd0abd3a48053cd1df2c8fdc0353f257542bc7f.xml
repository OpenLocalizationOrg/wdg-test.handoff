When you clear an application, the system removes the settings, shortcuts, and file type associations that correspond to the application and also removes the application from the user’s list of applications.\n\n**Note**  \nWhen you clear an application from the console, you can no longer use that application. However, the application remains in cache and is still available to other users on the same system. After a publishing refresh, the cleared applications will again become available to you. If there are multiple applications in a package, the user's settings are not removed until all of the applications are cleared.\n\n \n\n**To clear an application from the console**\n\n1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Clear** from the pop-up menu.\n\n2.  At the confirmation prompt, click **Yes** to remove the application or click **No** to cancel the operation.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
