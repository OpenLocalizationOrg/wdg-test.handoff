# Creating, Controlling, or Importing a GPO


To use Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) to provide change control for a Group Policy Object (GPO), the GPO must first be controlled by AGPM. New GPOs created through the **Change Control** folder will automatically be controlled. As an Editor, you may not have permission to complete the control, creation, or deletion of a GPO, but you do have the permission necessary to begin the process and submit your request to an Approver.
