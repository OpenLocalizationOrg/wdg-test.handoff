# Intro to Microsoft Surface Hub


Microsoft Surface Hub is an all-in-one productivity device that is intended for brainstorming, collaboration, and presentations. In order to get the maximum benefit from Surface Hub, your organization’s infrastructure and the Surface Hub itself must be properly set up and integrated. This guide describes what needs to be done both before and during setup in order to help you optimize your use of the device.

### <a href="" id="surface-hub-features-and-interactions"></a>Surface Hub features and interactions with other services

The capabilities of your Surface Hub will depend on what other Microsoft products and technologies are available to it in your infrastructure. The products listed in the following table each support specific features in Surface Hub.

### Surface Hub setup process

In some ways, adding your new Surface Hub is just like adding any other Microsoft Windows-based device to your network. However, in order to get your Surface Hub up and running at its full capacity, there are some very specific requirements. Read through all the info before you start. Here’s the general order of things you’ll need to do:

1.  [Prepare your environment for Surface Hub](prepare-your-environment-for-surface-hub.md)
2.  [Physically install your Surface Hub device](physically-install-your-surface-hub-device.md)
3.  [Run the Surface Hub first-run setup program (OOBE)](first-run-program-surface-hub.md)

After you have your Surface Hub running in your organization, you’ll need info about:

-   [Device maintenance and management](manage-surface-hub.md)

In the unlikely event that you run into problems, see [Troubleshoot Surface Hub](troubleshoot-surface-hub.md).
