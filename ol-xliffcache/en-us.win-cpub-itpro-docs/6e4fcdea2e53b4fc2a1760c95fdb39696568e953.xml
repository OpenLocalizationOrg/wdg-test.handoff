basic User State Migration Tool (USMT)10.0 migration by using XML files; these files provide instructions on where and how the USMT tools should gather and apply files and settings. USMT includes three XML files that you can use to customize a basic migration: the MigDocs.xml and MigUser.xml files, which modify how files are discovered on the source computer, and the MigApps.xml file, which is required in order to migrate supported application settings. You can also create and edit custom XML files and a Config.xml file to further customize your migration.\n\nThis topic provides an overview of the default and custom migration XML files and includes guidelines for creating and editing a customized version of the MigDocs.xml file. The MigDocs.xml file uses the new **GenerateDocPatterns** function available in USMT to automatically find user documents on a source computer.\n\n## In This Topic\n\n\n[Overview of the Config.xml file](#bkmk-config)\n\n[Overview of the MigApp.xml file](#bkmk-migapp)\n\n[Overview of the MigDocs.xml file](#bkmk-migdocs)\n\n[Overview of the MigUser.xml file](#bkmk-miguser)\n\n[Using multiple XML files](#bkmk-multiple)\n\n[XML rules for migrating user files](#bkmk-userfiles)\n\n[The GenerateDocPatterns function](#bkmk-generate)\n\n[Understanding the system and user context](#bkmk-context)\n\n[Sample migration rules for customized versions of XML files](#bkmk-samples)\n\n[Exclude rules usage examples](#bkmk-exclude)\n\n[Include rules usage examples](#bkmk-include)\n\n[Next Steps](#bkmk-next)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-config\"></a>Overview of the Config.xml file\n\n\nThe Config.xml file is the configuration file created by the `/genconfig` option of the ScanState tool; it can be used to modify which operating-system components are migrated by USMT. The Config.xml file can be used in conjunction with other XML files, such as in the following example: `scanstate /i:migapps.xml /i:migdocs.xml /genconfig:c:\\myFolder\\config.xml`. When used this way, the Config.xml file tightly controls aspects of the migration, including user profiles, data, and settings, without modifying or creating other XML files. For more information about the Config.xml file, see [Customize USMT XML Files](usmt-customize-xml-files.md) and [Config.xml File](usmt-configxml-file.md).\n\n**Note**  \nWhen modifying the XML elements in the Config.xml file, you should edit an element and set the **migrate** property to **no**, rather than deleting the element from the file. If you delete the element instead of setting the property, the component may still be migrated by rules in other XML files.\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-migapp\"></a>Overview of the MigApp.xml file\n\n\nThe MigApp.xml file installed with USMT includes instructions to migrate the settings for the applications listed in [What Does USMT Migrate?](usmt-what-does-usmt-migrate.md). You must include the MigApp.xml file when using the ScanState and LoadState tools, by using the `/i` option in order to migrate application settings. The MigDocs.xml and MigUser.xml files do not migrate application settings. You can create a custom XML file to include additional applications. For more information, see [Customize USMT XML Files](usmt-customize-xml-files.md).\n\n**Important**  \nThe MigApps.xml file will only detect and migrate .pst files that are linked to Microsoft Office Outlook. See the [Sample migration rules for customized versions of XML files](#bkmk-samples) section of this document for more information about migrating .pst files that are not linked to Outlook.\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-migdocs\"></a>Overview of the MigDocs.xml file\n\n\nThe MigDocs.xml file uses the new **GenerateDocPatterns** helper function to create instructions for USMT to migrate files from the source computer, based on the location of the files. You can use the MigDocs.xml file with the ScanState and LoadState tools to perform a more targeted migration than using USMT without XML instructions.\n\nThe default MigDocs.xml file migrates the following:\n\n-   All files on the root of the drive except %WINDIR%, %PROGRAMFILES%, %PROGRAMDATA%, or %USERS%.\n\n-   All folders in the root directory of all fixed drives. For example: c:\\\\data\\_mail\\\\\\*\\[\\*\\]\n\n-   All files from the root of the Profiles folder, except for files in the system profile. For example: c:\\\\users\\\\name\\[mail.pst\\]\n\n-   All folders from the root of the Profiles folder, except for the system-profile folders. For example: c:\\\\users\\\\name\\\\new folder\\\\\\*\\[\\*\\]\n\n-   Standard shared folders:\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_DESKTOPDIRECTORY\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_FAVORITES\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_DOCUMENTS\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_MUSIC\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_PICTURES\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_VIDEO\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_PublicDownloads\n\n-   Standard user-profile folders for each user:\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYDOCUMENTS\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYPICTURES\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_OriginalImages\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYMUSIC\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYVIDEO\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_FAVORITES\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_DESKTOP\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_QUICKLAUNCH\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_Contacts\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_Libraries\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_Downloads\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_SavedGames\n\n    -   FOLDERID\\_RecordedTV\n\nThe default MigDocs.xml file will not migrate the following:\n\n-   Files tagged with both the **hidden** and **system** attributes.\n\n-   Files and folders on removable drives.\n\n-   Data from the %WINDIR%, %PROGRAMDATA%, and %PROGRAMFILES% folders.\n\n-   Folders that contain installed applications.\n\nYou can also use the **/genmigxml** option with the ScanState tool to review and modify what files will be migrated.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-miguser\"></a>Overview of the MigUser.xml file\n\n\nThe MigUser.xml file includes instructions for USMT to migrate user files based on file name extensions. You can use the MigUser.xml file with the ScanState and LoadState tools to perform a more targeted migration than using USMT without XML instructions. The MigUser.xml file will gather all files from the standard user-profile folders, as well as any files on the computer with the specified file name extensions.\n\nThe default MigUser.xml file migrates the following:\n\n-   All files from the standard user-profile folders which are described as:\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYVIDEO\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYMUSIC\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_DESKTOP\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_STARTMENU\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_PERSONAL\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_MYPICTURES\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_FAVORITES\n\n    -   CSIDL\\_QUICK LAUNCH\n\n-   Files with the following extensions:\n\n    .qdf, .qsd, .qel, .qph, .doc\\*, .dot\\*, .rtf, .mcw, .wps, .scd, .wri, .wpd, .xl\\*, .csv, .iqy, .dqy, .oqy, .rqy, .wk\\*, .wq1, .slk, .dif, .ppt\\*, .pps\\*, .pot\\*, .sh3, .ch3, .pre, .ppa, .txt, .pst, .one\\*, .vl\\*, .vsd, .mpp, .or6, .accdb, .mdb, .pub\n\nThe default MigUser.xml file does not migrate the following:\n\n-   Files tagged with both the **hidden** and **system** attributes.\n\n-   Files and folders on removable drives,\n\n-   Data from the %WINDIR%, %PROGRAMFILES%, %PROGRAMDATA% folders.\n\n-   ACLS for files in folders outside the user profile.\n\nYou can make a copy of the MigUser.xml file and modify it to include or exclude standard user-profile folders and file name extensions. If you know all of the extensions for the files you want to migrate from the source computer, use the MigUser.xml file to move all of your relevant data, regardless of the location of the files. However, this may result in a migration that contains more files than intended. For example, if you choose to migrate all .jpg files, you may migrate image files such as thumbnails and logos from legacy applications that are installed on the source computer.\n\n**Note**  \nEach file name extension you include in the rules within the MigUser.xml file increases the amount of time needed for the ScanState tool to gather the files for the migration. If you are migrating more than three hundred file types, you may experience a slow migration. For more information about other ways to organize the migration of your data, see the [Using multiple XML files](#bkmk-multiple) section of this document.\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-multiple\"></a>Using multiple XML files\n\n\nYou can use multiple XML files with the ScanState and LoadState tools. Each of the default XML files included with or generated by USMT is configured for a specific component of the migration. You can also use custom XML files to supplement these default files with additional migration rules.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">XML migration file</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Modifies the following components:</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Config.xml file</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Operating-system components such as desktop wallpaper and background theme.</p>\n<p>You can also overload config.xml to include some application and document settings by generating the config.xml file with the other default XML files. For more information, see [Customize USMT XML Files](usmt-customize-xml-files.md) and [Config.xml File](usmt-configxml-file.md).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>MigApps.xml file</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Applications settings.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>MigUser.xml or MigDocs.xml files</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>User files and profile settings.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Custom XML files</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Application settings, user profile settings, or user files, beyond the rules contained in the other XML files.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nFor example, you can use all of the XML migration file types for a single migration, as in the following example:\n\n``` syntax\nScanstate <store> /config:c:\\myFolder\\config.xml /i:migapps.xml /i:migdocs.xml /i:customrules.xml\n```\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-userfiles\"></a>XML rules for migrating user files\n\n**Important**  \nYou should not use the MigUser.xml and MigDocs.xml files together in the same command. Using both XML files can result in duplication of some migrated files. This occurs when conflicting target-location instructions are given in each XML file. The target file will be stored once during the migration, but will be applied by each XML file to a different location on the destination computer.\n\n \n\nIf your data set is unknown or if many files are stored outside of the standard user-profile folders, the MigDocs.xml is a better choice than the MigUser.xml file, because the MigDocs.xml file will gather a broader scope of data. The MigDocs.xml file migrates folders of data based on location. The MigUser.xml file migrates only the files with the specified file name extensions.\n\nIf you want more control over the migration, you can create custom XML files. See the [Creating and editing a custom ,xml file](#bkmk-createxml) section of this document.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-createxml\"></a>Creating and editing a custom XML file\n\n\nYou can use the **/genmigxml** command-line option to determine which files will be included in your migration. The **/genmigxml** option creates a file in a location you specify, so that you can review the XML rules and make modifications as necessary.\n\n**Note**  \nIf you reinstall USMT, the default migration XML files will be overwritten and any customizations you make directly to these files will be lost. Consider creating separate XML files for your custom migration rules and saving them in a secure location.\n\n \n\nTo generate the XML migration rules file for a source computer:\n\n1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Accessories**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then click **Run as**.\n\n2.  Select an account with administrator privileges, supply a password, and then click **OK**.\n\n3.  At the command prompt, type:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    cd /d <USMTpath>\n    scanstate.exe /genmigxml: <filepath.xml>\n    ```\n\n    Where *&lt;USMTpath&gt;* is the location on your source computer where you have saved the USMT files and tools, and *&lt;filepath.xml&gt;* is the full path to a file where you can save the report. For example, type:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    cd /d c:\\USMT\n    scanstate.exe /genmigxml:\"C:\\Documents and Settings\\USMT Tester\\Desktop\\genMig.xml\"\n    ```\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-generate\"></a>The GenerateDocPatterns function\n\nThe MigDocs.xml file calls the **GenerateDocPatterns** function, which takes three Boolean values. You can change the settings to modify the way the MigDocs.xml file generates the XML rules for migration.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Setting</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Default Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>ScanProgramFiles</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The <em>ScanProgramFiles</em> argument is valid only when the <strong>GenerateDocPatterns</strong> function is called in a system context.

The system context applies to files on the computer that are not stored in the User Profiles directory, while the user context applies to files that are particular to an individual user.\n\n**System context**\n\nThe system context includes rules for data outside of the User Profiles directory. For example, when called in a system context in the MigDocs.xml file, the **GenerateDocPatterns** function creates patterns for all common shell folders, files in the root directory of hard drives, and folders located at the root of hard drives. The following folders are included:\n\n-   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_DESKTOPDIRECTORY\n\n-   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_FAVORITES\n\n-   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_DOCUMENTS\n\n-   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_MUSIC\n\n-   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_PICTURES\n\n-   CSIDL\\_COMMON\\_VIDEO\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_PublicDownloads\n\n**User context**\n\nThe user context includes rules for data in the User Profiles directory. When called in a user context in the MigDocs.xml file, the **GenerateDocPatterns** function creates patterns for all user shell folders, files located at the root of the profile, and folders located at the root of the profile. The following folders are included:\n\n-   CSIDL\\_MYDOCUMENTS\n\n-   CSIDL\\_MYPICTURES\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_OriginalImages\n\n-   CSIDL\\_MYMUSIC\n\n-   CSIDL\\_MYVIDEO\n\n-   CSIDL\\_FAVORITES\n\n-   CSIDL\\_DESKTOP\n\n-   CSIDL\\_QUICKLAUNCH\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_Contacts\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_Libraries\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_Downloads\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_SavedGames\n\n-   FOLDERID\\_RecordedTV\n\n**Note**  \nRules contained in a component that is assigned the user context will be run for each user profile on the computer. Files that are scanned multiple times by the MigDocs.xml files will only be copied to the migration store once; however, a large number of rules in the user context can slow down the migration. Use the system context when it is applicable.\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-samples\"></a>Sample migration rules for customized versions of XML files\n\n**Note**  \nFor best practices and requirements for customized XML files in USMT, see [Customize USMT XML Files](usmt-customize-xml-files.md) and [General Conventions](usmt-general-conventions.md).\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-exclude\"></a>Exclude rules usage examples\n\nIn the examples below, the source computer has a .txt file called \"new text document\" in a directory called \"new folder\". The default MigDocs.xml behavior migrates the new text document.txt file and all files contained in the \"new folder\" directory. The rules generated by the function are:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Rule 1</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><pre class=\"syntax\" space=\"preserve\"><code>&lt;pattern type=&quot;File&quot;&gt;d:\\new folder\\[new text document.txt]&lt;/pattern&gt;</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Rule 2</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><pre class=\"syntax\" space=\"preserve\"><code>&lt;pattern type=&quot;File&quot;&gt;d:\\new folder\\*[*]&lt;/pattern&gt;</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nTo exclude the new text document.txt file as well as any .txt files in “new folder”, you can do the following:\n\n**Example 1: Exclude all .txt files in a folder**\n\nTo exclude Rule 1, there needs to be an exact match of the file name. However, for Rule 2, you can create a pattern to exclude files by using the file name extension.\n\n``` syntax\n<exclude>\n     <objectSet>\n        <pattern type=\"File\">D:\\Newfolder\\[new text document.txt]</pattern>\n         <pattern type=\"File\">D:\\New folder\\*[*.txt]</pattern>\n     </objectSet>\n</exclude>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Use the UnconditionalExclude element to give a rule precedence over include rules**\n\nIf you do not know the file name or location of the file, but you do know the file name extension, you can use the **GenerateDrivePatterns** function. However, the rule will be less specific than the default include rule generated by the MigDocs.xml file, so it will not have precedence. You must use the &lt;UnconditionalExclude&gt; element to give this rule precedence over the default include rule. For more information about the order of precedence for XML migration rules, see [Conflicts and Precedence](usmt-conflicts-and-precedence.md).\n\n``` syntax\n<unconditionalExclude>\n     <objectSet>\n        <script>MigXmlHelper.GenerateDrivePatterns (\"*[*.txt]\", \"Fixed\")</script>\n     </objectSet>\n</unconditionalExclude>\n```\n\n**Example 3 : Use a UserandSystem context component to run rules in both contexts**\n\nIf you want the &lt;UnconditionalExclude&gt; element to apply to both the system and user context, you can create a third component using the **UserandSystem** context. Rules in this component will be run in both contexts.\n\n``` syntax\n<component type=\"Documents\" context=\"UserandSystem\">\n   <displayName>MigDocExcludes</displayName>\n   <role role=\"Data\">\n     <rules>\n       <unconditionalExclude>\n         <objectSet>\n                <script>MigXmlHelper.GenerateDrivePatterns (\"*[*.txt]\", \"Fixed\")</script>\n         </objectSet>\n       </unconditionalExclude>\n     </rules>\n   </role>\n</component>\n```\n\nFor more examples of exclude rules that you can use in custom migration XML files, see [Exclude Files and Settings](usmt-exclude-files-and-settings.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-include\"></a>Include rules usage examples\n\nThe application data directory is the most common location that you would need to add an include rule for. The **GenerateDocPatterns** function excludes this location by default. If your company uses an application that saves important data to this location, you can create include rules to migrate the data. For example, the default location for .pst files is: `%CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Outlook`. The Migapp.xml file contains migration rules to move only those .pst files that are linked to Microsoft Outlook. To include .pst files that are not linked, you can do the following:\n\n**Example 1: Include a file name extension in a known user folder**\n\nThis rule will include .pst files that are located in the default location, but are not linked to Microsoft Outlook. Use the user context to run this rule for each user on the computer.\n\n``` syntax\n<include filter='MigXmlHelper.IgnoreIrrelevantLinks()'>\n     <objectSet>\n        <pattern type=\"File\">%CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\*[*.pst]</pattern>\n     </objectSet>\n</include>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Include a file name extension in Program Files**\n\nFor locations outside the user profile, such as the Program Files folder, you can add the rule to the system context component.\n\n``` syntax\n<include filter='MigXmlHelper.IgnoreIrrelevantLinks()'>\n     <objectSet>\n        <pattern type=\"File\">%CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES%\\*[*.pst]</pattern>\n     </objectSet>\n</include>\n```\n\nFor more examples of include rules that you can use in custom migration XML files, see [Include Files and Settings](usmt-include-files-and-settings.md).\n\n**Note**  \nFor more information about the order of precedence for XML migration rules, see [Conflicts and Precedence](usmt-conflicts-and-precedence.md).\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-next\"></a>Next steps\n\n\nYou can include additional rules for the migration in the MigDocs.xml file or other XML migration files. For example, you can use the &lt;locationModify&gt; element to move files from the folder where they were gathered to a different folder, when they are applied to the destination computer.\n\nYou can use an XML schema (MigXML.xsd) file to validate the syntax of your customized XML files.
