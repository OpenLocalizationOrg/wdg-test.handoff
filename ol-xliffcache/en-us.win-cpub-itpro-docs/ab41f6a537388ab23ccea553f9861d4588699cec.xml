See [Planning for MBAM 2.0 Group Policy Requirements](planning-for-mbam-20-group-policy-requirements-mbam-2.md) for more information on the different policies that are available. After you have determined the policies that you are going to use, you then must modify one or more Group Policy Objects (GPO) that include the policy settings for MBAM.\n\nYou can use the following steps to configure the basic, recommended GPO settings to enable MBAM to manage BitLocker encryption for your organization’s client computers.\n\n**To Edit MBAM Client GPO Settings**\n\n1.  On a computer that has MBAM Group Policy template installed, make sure that MBAM services are enabled.\n\n2.  Using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC.msc) or the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) MDOP product on a computer with the MBAM Group Policy template installed, select **Computer configuration**, choose **Policies**, click **Administrative Templates**, select **Windows Components**, and then click **MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.\n\n3.  Edit the Group Policy Object settings that are required to enable MBAM Client services on client computers. For each policy in the table that follows, select **Policy Group**, click the **Policy**, and then configure the **Setting**:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    <col width=\"33%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Policy Group</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Policy</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Setting</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Client Management</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Configure MBAM Services</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Enabled.
