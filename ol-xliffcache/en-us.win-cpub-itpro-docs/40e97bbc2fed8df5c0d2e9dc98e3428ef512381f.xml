whether the operating system generates audit events when a computer account is created, changed, or deleted.\n\nThis policy setting is useful for tracking account-related changes to computers that are members of a domain.\n\n**Event volume**: Low on domain controllers.\n\nThis subcategory allows you to audit events generated by changes to computer accounts such as when a computer account is created, changed, or deleted.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments
