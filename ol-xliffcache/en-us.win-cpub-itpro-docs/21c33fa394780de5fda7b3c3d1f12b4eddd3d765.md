# Manage private store settings


**Applies to**

The private store is a feature in the Windows Store for Business that organizations receive during the sign up process. When admins add apps to the private store, all employees in the organization can view and download the apps. Only online-licensed apps can be distributed from your private store.

The name of your private store is shown on a tab in the Windows Store.
