The rule is therefore not enforceable on the computer and so is excluded from the runtime state of the firewall. This is not necessarily an error. Examine the rule for applicability on the computers to which it was applied.\n\nThere is no example of this event in this document.\n\n***Subcategory:***&nbsp;[Audit MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change](audit-mpssvc-rule-level-policy-change.md)\n\n***Event Schema:***\n\n*Windows Firewall did not apply the following rule because the rule referred to items not configured on this computer:\nRule Information:\n%tID:%t%1\n%tName:%t%2\nError Information:\n%tError:%t%3\n%tReason:%t%4*\n\n***Required Server Roles:*** None.\n\n***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista.\n\n***Event Versions:*** 0.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\n-   This event can be a sign of software issues, Windows Firewall registry errors or corruption, or Group Policy setting misconfigurations.
