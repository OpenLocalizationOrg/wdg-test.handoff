# Audit Handle Manipulation

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


Audit Handle Manipulation enables generation of “4658: The handle to an object was closed” in [Audit File System](audit-file-system.md), [Audit Kernel Object](audit-kernel-object.md), [Audit Registry](audit-registry.md), [Audit Removable Storage](audit-removable-storage.md) and [Audit SAM](audit-sam.md) subcategories, and shows object’s handle duplication and close actions.


            **Event volume**: High.

| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
