For example, if you currently deploy applications to physical computers by using an electronic software distribution system, you can also use your electronic software distribution system to deploy to MED-V workspaces.\n\nIf you are currently using an electronic software distribution solution, you can use that to distribute MED-V workspaces and their dependent applications. You can also use this solution for distribution of subsequent applications after MED-V is deployed. For more information about deploying MED-V with an ESD, see [How to Deploy a MED-V Workspace Through an Electronic Software Distribution System](how-to-deploy-a-med-v-workspace-through-an-electronic-software-distribution-system.md).\n\n**Note**  \nWhichever electronic software distribution solution that you use, you must be familiar with the requirements of your particular solution. If you are using System Center Configuration Manager 2007 R2 or a later version, see the [Configuration Manager Documentation Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=66999) in the Microsoft Technical Library (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=66999).\n\n \n\nYou might prefer to install MED-V in a Windows 7 image. Then, after you deploy the Windows 7 images throughout your enterprise, MED-V is ready to be installed when an end user needs it. For more information, see [How to Deploy a MED-V Workspace in a Windows 7 Image](how-to-deploy-a-med-v-workspace-in-a-windows-7-image.md).\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Define and Plan your MED-V Deployment](define-and-plan-your-med-v-deployment.md)\n\n[Planning for MED-V](planning-for-med-v.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
