Authentication\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview\n\nSometimes a device cannot join an Active Directory domain, and therefore cannot use Kerberos V5 authentication with domain credentials. However, the device can still participate in the isolated domain by using certificate-based authentication.\n\nThe non-domain member server, and the clients that must be able to communicate with it, must be configured to use cryptographic certificates based on the X.509 standard. These certificates can be used as an alternate set of credentials. During IKE negotiation, each device sends a copy of its certificate to the other device. Each device examines the received certificate, and then validates its authenticity. To be considered authentic, the received certificate must be validated by a certification authority certificate in the recipient's Trusted Root Certification Authorities store on the local device.\n\nCertificates can be acquired from commercial firms, or by an internal certificate server set up as part of the organization's public key infrastructure (PKI). Microsoft provides a complete PKI and certification authority solution with Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008 Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).\n\n## Deploying certificates\n\nNo matter how you acquire your certificates, you must deploy them to clients and servers that require them in order to communicate.\n\n### Using Active Directory Certificate Services\n\nIf you use AD CS to create your own user and device certificates in-house, then the servers designated as certification authorities (CAs) create the certificates based on administrator-designed templates. AD CS then uses Group Policy to deploy the certificates to domain member devices. Device certificates are deployed when a domain member device starts. User certificates are deployed when a user logs on.\n\nIf you want non-domain member devices to be part of a server isolation zone that requires access by only authorized users, make sure to include certificate mapping to associate the certificates with specific user accounts. When certificate mapping is enabled, the certificate issued to each device or user includes enough identification information to enable IPsec to match the certificate to both user and device accounts.\n\nAD CS automatically ensures that certificates issued by the CAs are trusted by the client devices by putting the CA certificates in the correct store on each domain member device.\n\n### Using a commercially purchased certificate for devices running Windows\n\nYou can import the certificates manually onto each device if the number of devices is relatively small. For a deployment to more than a handful of devices, use Group Policy.\n\nYou must first download the vendor's root CA certificate, and then import it to a GPO that deploys it to the Local Computer\\\\Trusted Root Certification Authorities store on each device that applies the GPO.\n\nYou must also import the purchased certificate into a GPO that deploys it to the Local Computer\\\\Personal store on each device that applies the GPO.\n\n### Using a commercially purchased certificate for devices running a non-Windows operating system\n\nIf you are installing the certificates on an operating system other than Windows, see the documentation for that operating system.\n\n## Configuring IPsec to use the certificates\n\nWhen the clients and servers have the certificates available, you can configure the IPsec and connection security rules to include those certificates as a valid authentication method. The authentication method requires the subject name of the certificate, for example: **DC=com,DC=woodgrovebank,CN=CorporateCertServer**. Optionally, select **Enable certificate to account mapping** to support using these credentials for restricting access to users or devices that are members of authorized groups in a server isolation solution.\n\nStarting in Windows Server 2012,you can configure certificate selection criteria so the desired certificate is selected and/or validated. Enhanced Key Usage (EKU) criteria can be configured, as well as name restrictions and certificate thumbprints. This is configured using the **Advanced** button when choosing certificates for the authentication method in the user interface, or through Windows PowerShell.\n\n**Next: **[Documenting the Zones](documenting-the-zones.md)\n"}
