Once an app is part of your inventory, you can distribute the app, and manage licenses.\n\n## Distribute apps\nYou can assign apps to people, or you can make apps available in your private store.

Store for Business will update the list of apps on the **Inventory** page.\n4.  From an app in **Inventory**, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **Add to private store**.\n\nThe value under Private store for the app will change to pending.

Click the link to start the Windows Store app, and then click **Install**. Also, in the Windows Store app, they can find the app under **My Library**. \n\n## Manage licenses\nFor apps in inventory, when you assign an app to an employee, a license for the app is assigned to them. You can manage these licenses, either by assigning them, or reclaiming them so you can assign them to another employee. You can also remove an app from the private store. \n\n**To assign licenses**\n1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).\n2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.\n3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **View license details**.\n4.  Click **Assign to people**, type the name you are assigning the license to, and then click **Assign**. \n\nStore for Business assigns a license to the person, and adds them to the list of assigned licenses. \n\n**To reclaim licenses**\n1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).\n2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.\n3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **View license details**.\n4.  Click the name of the person you are reclaiming the license from, and then click **Reclaim licenses**. \n\nStore for Business reclaims the license, and updates the number of avialable licenses. After you reclaim a license, you can assign a license to another employee. \n\n**To remove an app from the private store**\n\nIf you decide that you don't want an app available for employees to install on their own, you can remove it from your private store. \n1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).\n2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.\n3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **Remove from private store**, and then click **Remove**.\n\nThe app will still be in your inventory, but your employees will not have access to the app from your private store. \n"}
