# Managing the AGPM Service


The AGPM Service is a Windows service that acts as a security proxy, managing client access to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the archive and production environment. It enforces Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) delegation and provides an enhanced level of security. The AGPM Service is hosted on the server on which the Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management - Server is installed.

**Caution**  
Do not modify settings for the AGPM Service through **Administrative Tools** and **Services** in the operating system. Doing so can prevent the AGPM Service from starting.
