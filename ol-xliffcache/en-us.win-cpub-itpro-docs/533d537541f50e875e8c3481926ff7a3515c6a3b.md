# Contents Tab


The **Contents** tab on the **Change Control** pane provides access to Group Policy objects (GPOs) and a shortcut menu for managing GPOs. The options displayed when right-clicking items are dependent on your role, your permissions, and your ownership stake in the GPO being managed. Additionally, these shortcut menus differ with the state of the GPO being managed.

The secondary tabs filter the list of GPOs displayed.

-   
            [Controlled Tab](controlled-tab.md): GPOs managed by AGPM

-   
            [Uncontrolled Tab](uncontrolled-tab.md): GPOs not managed by AGPM

-   
            [Pending Tab](pending-tab.md): GPO changes awaiting approval by an Approver

-   
            [Templates Tab](templates-tab.md): GPO templates for creating new GPOs and comparing to existing GPOs

-   
            [Recycle Bin Tab](recycle-bin-tab.md): Deleted GPOs

Additionally, the secondary tabs provide access to the History of each GPO and to other features:

-   [Common Secondary Tab Features](common-secondary-tab-features.md)

-   [History Window](history-window.md)
