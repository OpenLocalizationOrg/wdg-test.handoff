MED-V workspace the same way they are initiated from the desktop—from the Start menu or from a local host shortcut. Applications selected and defined are called published applications. The procedures in this section describe how to add and remove published applications.\n\nAn application can be published in one of the following ways:\n\n-   As an application—Select a specific application by typing in the command line for the application. Only the application selected is published.\n\n-   As a menu—Select a folder that contains multiple applications. All applications within the folder are published and displayed as a menu.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-addingapublishedapplication\"></a>How to Add a Published Application to a MED-V Workspace\n\n\n**To add an application to the MED-V workspace**\n\n1.
