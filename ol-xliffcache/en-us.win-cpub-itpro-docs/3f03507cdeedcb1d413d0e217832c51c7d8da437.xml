You can sign code integrity policies with the Device Guard signing portal.\n\n## Sign your code integrity policy\n\n\nBefore you get started, be sure to review these best practices:\n\n**Best practices**\n\n-   Test your code integrity policies on a group of devices before deploying them to a large group of devices.\n\n-   Use rule options 9 and 10 during testing. For more information, see the section Code integrity policy rules in the [Device Guard deployment guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt463091.aspx).\n\n**To sign a code integrity policy**\n\n1.  Sign in to the Windows Store for Business\n\n2.  Click **Settings**, and then choose **Device Guard signing**.\n\n3.  Click **Upload** to upload your code integrity policy.\n\n4.  After the files are uploaded, click **Sign** to sign the code integrity policy.\n\n5.  Click **Download** to download the signed code integrity policy.\n\n    When you sign a code integrity policy with the Device Guard signing portal, the signing certificate is added to the policy. This means you can't modify this policy. If you need to make changes, make them to an unsigned version of the policy, and then resign the policy.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
