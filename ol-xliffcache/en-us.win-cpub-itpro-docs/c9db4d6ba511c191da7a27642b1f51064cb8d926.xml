To create the .sft file by using the command line, enter the following at a command prompt:\n\n**mkdiffpkg.exe &lt;base SFT file name&gt; &lt;diff SFT file name&gt;**\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"file-name-in-osd-file-is-not-correct-after-package-upgrade-\"></a>File Name in OSD File Is Not Correct After Package Upgrade\n\n\nAfter you upgrade an existing package, the file name is not correct.\n\n**Solution**\n\nWhen you open a package for upgrade, you should specify the root Q:\\\\ drive as the output location for the package. Do not specify an associated file name with the output location.\n\n## Microsoft Word 2003 Default Install Results in an Error When Streamed to a Client\n\n\nWhen you stream Microsoft Word 2003 to a client, an error is returned but Microsoft Word continues to run.\n\n**Solution**\n\nResequence the virtual application package, and select **Full Install**.\n\n## Package Upgrade Does Not Work When You Create a Dependent Package\n\n\nWhen you create a dependent package by using package upgrade and add new registry entries, it appears to function correctly but the updated registry entries are not available.\n\n**Solution**\n\nRegistry settings are always stored with the original version of the package, so updates to the package will not appear to be available unless you repair the original package.\n\n## Error When Trying to Sequence .NET 2.0\n\n\nWhen you sequence a package that requires .NET 2.0, you get an error.\n\n**Solution**\n\nSequencing packages that require .NET 2.0 is not supported.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Sequencer](application-virtualization-sequencer.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
