The client should be installed with the *REQUIREAUTHORIZATIONIFCACHED* parameter set to 0 (zero). For more information about setting this parameter, see [Application Virtualization Client Installer Command-Line Parameters](application-virtualization-client-installer-command-line-parameters.md)\n\n2.  Copy the Windows Installer file and the SFT file to same folder on the target computer.\n\n3.  Run the following command on the computer:\n\n    `Msiexec.exe /I “packagename.msi” /q`\n\n**To publish a package using Windows Installer and the package manifest**\n\n1.  Copy the Windows Installer file to the target computer and the SFT file to the CONTENT share on the streaming server.\n\n2.  Run the following command on each user’s computer:\n\n    `Msiexec.exe /I “\\\\pathtomsi\\packagename.msi” MODE=STREAMING  OVERRIDEURL=”\\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\package.sft” LOAD=TRUE /q`\n\n    **Important**  \n    For OVERRIDEURL all backslash characters must be escaped using a preceding backslash, or the OVERRIDEURL path will not be parsed correctly. Also, properties and values must be entered as uppercase except where the value is a path to a file.\n\n     \n\n**To publish a package using SFTMIME**\n\n-   For an example of how to publish an application for all users on a computer, run the following command on the user’s computer:\n\n    `SFTMIME ADD PACKAGE:package-name /MANIFEST manifest-path                                 [/GLOBAL] [/LOG log-pathname | /CONSOLE | /GUI]`\n\n    For additional details about these and other SFTMIME commands, see [SFTMIME Command Reference](sftmime--command-reference.md).\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Determine Your Publishing Method](determine-your-publishing-method.md)\n\n[Electronic Software Distribution-Based Scenario](electronic-software-distribution-based-scenario.md)\n\n[SFTMIME Command Reference](sftmime--command-reference.md)\n\n[Stand-Alone Delivery Scenario for Application Virtualization Clients](stand-alone-delivery-scenario-for-application-virtualization-clients.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
