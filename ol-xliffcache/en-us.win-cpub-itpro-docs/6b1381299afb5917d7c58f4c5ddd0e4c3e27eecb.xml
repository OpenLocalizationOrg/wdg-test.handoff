Policy Change\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Authentication Policy Change determines whether the operating system generates audit events when changes are made to authentication policy.\n\nChanges made to authentication policy include:\n\n-   Creation, modification, and removal of forest and domain trusts.\n\n-   Changes to Kerberos policy under Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account Policies\\\\Kerberos Policy.\n\n-   When any of the following user logon rights is granted to a user or group:\n\n    -   Access this computer from the network\n\n    -   Allow logon locally\n\n    -   Allow logon through Remote Desktop\n\n    -   Logon as a batch job\n\n    -   Logon as a service\n\n-   Namespace collision, such as when an added trust collides with an existing namespace name.\n\nThis setting is useful for tracking changes in domain-level and forest-level trust and privileges that are granted to user accounts or groups.\n\n**Event volume**: Low.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments
