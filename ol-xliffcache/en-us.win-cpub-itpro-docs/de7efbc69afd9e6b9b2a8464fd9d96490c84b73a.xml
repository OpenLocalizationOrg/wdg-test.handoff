downloads for Surface devices and links to download the drivers and firmware for your device.\n\nAs easy as it is to keep Surface device drivers and firmware up to date automatically with Windows Update, it is sometimes necessary to download and install updates manually, such as during a Windows deployment. For any situation where you need to install drivers and firmware separately from Windows Update, you can find the files available for download at the Microsoft Download Center.\n\nOn the Microsoft Download Center page for your device, you will find several files available. These files allow you to deploy drivers and firmware in various ways. You can read more about the different deployment methods for Surface drivers and firmware in [Manage Surface driver and firmware updates](manage-surface-pro-3-firmware-updates.md).\n\nDriver and firmware updates for Surface devices are released in one of two ways:\n\n-   **Point updates** are released for specific drivers or firmware revisions and provide the latest update for a specific component of the Surface device.\n\n-   **Cumulative updates** provide comprehensive roundups of all of the latest files for the Surface device running that version of Windows.\n\nInstallation files for administrative tools, drivers for accessories, and updates for Windows are also available for some devices and are detailed here in this article.\n\n>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify the process of locating drivers for your device, downloads for Surface devices have been reorganized to separate pages for each model. Bookmark the Microsoft Download Center page for your device from the links provided on this page. Many of the filenames contain a placeholder denoted with *xxxxxx*, which identifies the current version number or date of the file.\n \n\nRecent additions to the downloads for Surface devices provide you with options to install Windows 10 on your Surface devices and update LTE devices with the latest Windows 10 drivers and firmware.\n\n>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;A battery charge of 40% or greater is required before you install firmware to a Surface device.
