to access files and folders on a shared folder.\n\nThe Detailed File Share setting logs an event every time a file or folder is accessed, whereas the File Share setting only records one event for any connection established between a client and file share. Detailed File Share audit events include detailed information about the permissions or other criteria used to grant or deny access.\n\nThere are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shared folders. If this policy setting is enabled, access to all shared files and folders on the system is audited.\n\n**Event volume**:\n\n-   High on file servers.\n\n-   High on domain controllers because of SYSVOL network access required by Group Policy.\n\n-   Low on member servers and workstations.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | No              | Yes             | No               | Yes              | Audit Success for this subcategory on domain controllers typically will lead to very high volume of events, especially for SYSVOL share.<br>We recommend monitoring Failure access attempts: the volume should not be very high.
