Over time, you may find you need to disable a particular fix in your customized database. For example, if a software vendor releases a fix for an issue addressed in one of your compatibility fixes, you must validate that the vendor's fix is correct and that it resolves your issue. To do this, you must temporarily disable the compatibility fix and then test your application.\n\n**Important**  \nApplication Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) installs a 32-bit and a 64-bit version of the Compatibility Administrator tool. You must use the 32-bit version to work with custom databases for 32-bit applications and the 64-bit version to work with custom databases for 64-bit applications.\n\n \n\n**To disable a compatibility fix within a database**\n\n1.  In the left-sde pane of Compatibility Administrator, expand the custom database that includes the compatibility fix that you want to disable, and then select the specific compatibility fix.\n\n    The compatibility fix details appear in the right-hand pane.\n\n2.  On the **Database** menu, click **Disable Entry**.\n\n    **Important**  \n    When you disable an entry, it will remain disabled even if you do not save the database file.\n\n     \n\n## Enabling Compatibility Fixes\n\n\nYou can enable your disabled compatibility fixes at any time.\n\n**To enable a compatibility fix within a database**\n\n1.  In the left-side pane of Compatibility Administrator, expand the custom database that includes the compatibility fix that you want to enable, and then select the specific compatibility fix.\n\n    The compatibility fix details appear in the right-side pane.\n\n2.  On the **Database** menu, click **Enable Entry**.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Compatibility Administrator User's Guide](compatibility-administrator-users-guide.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
