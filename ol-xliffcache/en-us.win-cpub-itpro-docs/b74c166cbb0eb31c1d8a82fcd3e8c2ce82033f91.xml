In the case of an interactive logon, these events are generated on the computer that was logged on to.\n\nThere is no failure event in this subcategory because failed logoffs (such as when a system abruptly shuts down) do not generate an audit record.\n\nLogon events are essential to understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks. Logoff events are not 100 percent reliable. For example, the computer can be turned off without a proper logoff and shutdown; in this case, a logoff event is not generated.\n\n**Event volume**: Low.\n\nThis subcategory allows you to audit events generated by the closing of a logon session. These events occur on the computer that was accessed. For an interactive logoff the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user account logged on to.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | No              | No              | Yes              | No               | This subcategory typically generates huge amount of “[4634](event-4634.md)(S): An account was logged off.” events which, typically has little security relevance.
