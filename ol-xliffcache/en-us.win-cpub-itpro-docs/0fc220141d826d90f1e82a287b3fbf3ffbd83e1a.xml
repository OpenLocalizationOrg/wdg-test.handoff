The archive path can point to a folder on the AGPM Server or on another server in the same forest.\n\nThe archive path and AGPM Service Account are configured during the installation of AGPM Server and can be changed afterward through **Add or Remove Programs** on the AGPM Server.\n\nA user account that is a member of the Domain Admins group and has access to the AGPM Server (the computer on which Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management - Server is installed) is required to complete this procedure.\n\n**To modify the archive path**\n\n1.  On the computer on which Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management - Server is installed, click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, click **Add or Remove Programs**.\n\n2.  Click **Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management - Server**, and then click **Change**.\n\n3.  Click **Next**, and then click **Modify**.\n\n4.  Follow the instructions on screen to configure settings for the AGPM Service:\n\n    1.  For the archive path, enter a new location for the archive relative to the AGPM Server. The archive path can point to a folder on the AGPM Server or elsewhere, but the location should have sufficient space to store all GPOs and history data managed by this AGPM Server.\n\n    2.  Enter credentials for the AGPM Service Account.\n\n        **Important**  \n        Modifying the installation clears the credentials for the AGPM Service Account. You must re-enter credentials, but they are not required to match the credentials used during the original installation.\n\n        The AGPM Service Account must have full access to the GPOs that it will manage. If you will be managing GPOs on a single domain, you can make the Local System account for the primary domain controller the AGPM Service Account.\n\n        If you will be managing GPOs on multiple domains or if a member server will be the AGPM Server, you should configure a different account as the AGPM Service Account because the Local System account for one domain controller cannot access GPOs on other domains.\n\n         \n\n    3.  For the archive owner, enter the credentials of an AGPM Administrator (Full Control).\n\n5.  Click **Change**, and when the installation is complete click **Finish**.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Managing the AGPM Service](managing-the-agpm-service.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
