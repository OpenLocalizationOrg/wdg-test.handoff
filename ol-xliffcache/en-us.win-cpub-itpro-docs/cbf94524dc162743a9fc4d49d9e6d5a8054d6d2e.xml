The MED-V Administration Toolkit lets you access and configure event logs, restart or reset the MED-V workspace, and view the published applications and redirected web addresses in the MED-V workspace. You can also use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to open the MED-V workspace virtual machine in full-screen mode.\n\n## To Open the MED-V Administration Toolkit\n\n\nPerform the following steps to open the MED-V Administration Toolkit:\n\n1.  On the host computer that contains the MED-V workspace you are troubleshooting, open a Command Prompt window.\n\n2.  Browse to %systemdrive%\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization.\n\n3.  At the command prompt, type **MedvHost /toolkit**.\n\nAfter the MED-V Administration Toolkit opens, you can use the toolkit to help resolve issues in the MED-V workspace found during troubleshooting.\n\n## In this Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"viewing-and-configuring-med-v-logs\"></a>[Viewing and Configuring MED-V Logs](viewing-and-configuring-med-v-logs.md)  \nDescribes how to use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to collect and manage MED-V event logs in the host computer and the guest virtual machine.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"restarting-and-resetting-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[Restarting and Resetting a MED-V Workspace](restarting-and-resetting-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes how to restart and reset MED-V workspaces by using the MED-V Administration Toolkit.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"viewing-med-v-workspace-configurations\"></a>[Viewing MED-V Workspace Configurations](viewing-med-v-workspace-configurations.md)  \nDescribes how to use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to view the published applications and redirected web addresses in a MED-V workspace and how to open the MED-V workspace virtual machine in full-screen mode.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[MED-V Event Log Messages](med-v-event-log-messages.md)\n\n[Troubleshooting MED-V](troubleshooting-med-vmedv2.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
