privilege\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, and security considerations for the **Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThe **Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege** policy setting determines whether to audit the use of all user rights, including Backup and Restore, when the **Audit privilege use** policy setting is configured. Enabling both policy settings generates an audit event for every file that is backed up or restored.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n-   Disabled\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set **Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege** to Disabled. Enabling this policy setting can generate a large number of security events, which might cause servers to respond slowly and force the security event log to record numerous events of little significance.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy | Not defined |\n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined |\n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled | \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled | \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled | \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled | \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a computer restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n### Auditing\n\nEnabling this policy setting in conjunction with the **Audit privilege use** policy setting records any instance of user rights that are being exercised in the security log. If **Audit privilege use** is enabled but **Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege** is disabled, when users use backup or restore user rights, those events will not be audited.\n\nEnabling this policy setting when the **Audit privilege use** policy setting is also enabled generates an audit event for every file that is backed up or restored. This can help you to track down an administrator who is accidentally or maliciously restoring data in an unauthorized manner.\n\nAlternately, you can use the advanced audit policy, [Audit Sensitive Privilege Use](audit-sensitive-privilege-use.md), which can help you manage the number of events generated.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nWhen the backup and restore function is used, it creates a copy of the file system that is identical to the target of the backup. Making regular backup and restore volumes is an important part of your incident response plan. However, a malicious user could use a legitimate backup copy to gain access to information or to impersonate a legitimate network resource to compromise your enterprise.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nEnable the **Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege** setting. Alternatively, implement automatic log backup by configuring the **AutoBackupLogFiles** registry key. If you enable this option when the [Audit privilege use](basic-audit-privilege-use.md) setting is also enabled, an audit event is generated for every file that is backed up or restored. This information could help you to identify an account that was used to accidentally or maliciously restore data in an unauthorized manner.\nFor more information about configuring this key, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article [100879](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=100879).\n\n### Potential impact\n\nIf you enable this policy setting, a large number of security events could be generated, which could cause servers to respond slowly and force the security event log to record numerous events of little significance. If you increase the security event log size to reduce the chances of a system shutdown, an excessively large log file may affect system performance.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n \n \n"}
