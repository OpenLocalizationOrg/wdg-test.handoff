# Review events and errors on endpoints with Event Viewer

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14332 or later
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

<span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>

You can review event IDs in the [Event Viewer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/aa745633(v=bts.10).aspx) on individual endpoints.

For example, if endpoints are not appearing in the **Machines view** list, you might need to look for event IDs on the endpoints. You can then use this table to determine further troubleshooting steps.

> 
            **Note**            &nbsp;&nbsp;It can take several days for endpoints to begin reporting to the Windows Defender ATP service.

**Open Event Viewer and find the Windows Defender ATP service event log:**

1.  Click **Start**, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2.  In the log list, under **Log Summary**, scroll until you see **Microsoft-Windows-SENSE/Operational**. Double-click the item to open the log.

  a.  You can also access the log by expanding **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **SENSE** and click on **Operational**.

    > 
            **Note**            &nbsp;&nbsp;SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Windows Defender ATP.

3.  Events recorded by the service will appear in the log. See the following table for a list of events recorded by the service.
