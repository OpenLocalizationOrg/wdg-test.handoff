Gather your application and device inventory. For more information, see [Taking Inventory of Your Organization](taking-inventory-of-your-organization.md).\n\n2.  Use the Microsoft Compatibility Exchange to get the latest compatibility ratings. For more information, see [Sending and Receiving Compatibility Data](sending-and-receiving-compatibility-data.md).\n\n3.  Organize and group your applications, and determine which applications need to be tested. For more information, see [Organizing Your Compatibility Data](organizing-your-compatibility-data.md).\n\n    After completing these steps, you can then start creating and deploying your runtime-analysis packages to the test environment for your compatibility testing.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Creating an Enterprise Environment for Compatibility Testing](creating-an-enterprise-environment-for-compatibility-testing.md)\n\n[Creating a Runtime-Analysis Package](creating-a-runtime-analysis-package.md)\n\n[Deploying a Runtime-Analysis Package](deploying-a-runtime-analysis-package.md)\n\n[Compatibility Monitor User's Guide](compatibility-monitor-users-guide.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
