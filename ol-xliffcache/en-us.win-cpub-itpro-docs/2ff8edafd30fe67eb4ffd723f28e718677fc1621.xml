Right-click the **Change Control** node, and then click **New Controlled GPO**.\n\n3.  Unless you have special permission to create GPOs, you must submit a request for creation. In the **New Controlled GPO** dialog box:\n\n    1.  To receive a copy of the request, enter your e-mail address in the **Cc** field.\n\n    2.  Type a name for the new GPO.\n\n    3.  Optional: Type a comment for the new GPO.\n\n    4.  To deploy the new GPO to the production environment immediately upon approval, click **Create live**.
