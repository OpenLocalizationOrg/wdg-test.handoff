The end user then finishes the installation of the MED-V workspace by clicking a **Start** menu shortcut that you configure to start MED-V. First time setup starts and the end user follows the instructions to complete the configuration.\n\nThe following section provides information and instructions to help you deploy the MED-V workspace throughout your enterprise by using a Windows 7 image.\n\n**To deploy a MED-V workspace in a Windows 7 image**\n\n1.  Create a standard image of Windows 7. For more information, see [Building a Standard Image of Windows 7: Step-by-Step Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204843) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204843).\n\n2.  In the Windows 7 image, install Windows Virtual PC and the Windows Virtual PC updates. For more information, see [Configure Installation Prerequisites](configure-installation-prerequisites.md).\n\n3.  Install the MED-V Host Agent by using the MED-V\\_HostAgent\\_Setup installation file. For more information, see [How to Manually Install the MED-V Host Agent](how-to-manually-install-the-med-v-host-agent.md).\n\n    **Warning**  \n    Internet Explorer must be closed before you install the MED-V Host Agent, otherwise conflicts can occur later with URL redirection. You can also do this by specifying a computer restart during a distribution.\n\n     \n\n4.  Copy the MED-V workspace package files to the Windows 7 image. The MED-V workspace package files are the MED-V workspace installer, .medv file, and setup.exe file that you created by using the **MED-V Workspace Packager**.\n\n    **Important**  \n    The .medv and setup.exe file must be in the same folder as the MED-V workspace installer. Then, install the MED-V workspace by running setup.exe.\n\n     \n\n5.  Configure a shortcut on the **Start** menu to open the MED-V workspace package installation.\n\n    Create a **Start** menu shortcut to the setup.exe file that lets the end user start a MED-V installation as required.\n\n6.  By using your company’s standard image deployment process, distribute the Windows 7 image to computers in your enterprise that require MED-V.\n\nWhen the end user has to access an application published in the MED-V workspace, they can click the **Start** menu shortcut to install the MED-V workspace. This automatically starts first time setup and completes the configuration of MED-V. After first time setup is complete, the end user can access the MED-V applications on the **Start** menu.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[MED-V 2.0 Deployment Overview](med-v-20-deployment-overview.md)\n\n[How to Deploy a MED-V Workspace Through an Electronic Software Distribution System](how-to-deploy-a-med-v-workspace-through-an-electronic-software-distribution-system.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
