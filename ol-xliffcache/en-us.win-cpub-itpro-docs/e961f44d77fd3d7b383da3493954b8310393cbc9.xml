your **Inventory** page.\n\nThe **Inventory** page in Windows Store for Business shows all apps in your inventory. This includes all apps that you've acquired from Store for Business, and the line-of-business (LOB) apps that you've accepted into your inventory. After LOB apps are submitted to your organization, you'll see a notification on your **Inventory** page. On the **New line-of-business apps** page, you can accept, or reject the LOB apps. For more information on LOB apps, see [Working with line-of-business apps](working-with-line-of-business-apps.md).\n\nAll of these apps are treated the same once they are in your inventory and you can perform app lifecycle tasks for them: distribute apps, add apps to private store, review license details, and reclaim app licenses.\n\n![](images/wsfb-inventoryaddprivatestore.png)\n\nStore for Business shows this info for each app in your inventory:\n\n-   Name\n\n-   Access to actions for the app\n\n-   Last modified date\n\n-   Supported devices\n\n-   Private store status\n\n### Find apps in your inventory\n\nThere are a couple of ways to find specific apps, or groups of apps in your inventory.\n\n**Search** - Use the Search box to search for an app.\n\n**Refine** - Use **Refine** to scope your list of apps by one or more of these app attributes:\n\n-   **License** - Online or offline licenses.

Once it is configured to work with Store for Business, your managment tool will have access to all apps in your inventory. For more information, see [Distribute apps with a management tool](distribute-apps-with-management-tool.md).\n\nOnce an app is in your private store, people in your org can install the app on their devices.

It will take approximately twelve hours before the app is available in the private store. \n\nEmployees can claim apps that admins added to the private store by doing the following.\n\n**To claim an app from the private store**\n\n1.  Sign in to your computer with your Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials, and start the Windows Store app.\n2.  Click the private store tab.\n3.  Click the app you want to install, and then click **Install**.\n\nAnother way to distribute apps is by assigning them to people in your organization.\n\nIf you decide that you don't want an app available for employees to install on their own, you can remove it from your private store.\n\n**To remove an app from the private store**\n \n1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).\n2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.\n3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **Remove from private store**, and then click **Remove**.\n\nThe app will still be in your inventory, but your employees will not have access to the app from your private store. \n\n**To assign an app to an employee**\n\n1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).\n2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.\n3.

Click the link to start the Windows Store app, and then click **Install**.

It also allows you to reclaim app licenses after they've been assigned to people, or claimed by people in your organization.\n\n**To view license details**\n\n1.  Sign in to [Store for Business](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=691845)\n\n2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.\n\n3.  Click the ellipses for and app, and then choose **View license details**.\n\n    ![](images/wsfb-inventory-viewlicense.png)\n\n    You'll see the names of people in your organization who have installed the app and are using one of the licenses.\n\n    ![](images/wsfb-licensedetails.png)\n\n    On **Assigned licenses**, you can do several things:\n\n    -   Assign the app to other people in your organization.\n\n    -   Reclaim app licenses.\n\n    -   View app details.\n\n    -   Add the app to your private store, if it is not in the private store.\n\n    You can assign the app to more people in your organization, or reclaim licenses.\n\n    **To assign an app to more people**\n\n    -   Click Assign to people, type the email address for the employee that you're assigning the app to, and click **Assign**.\n\n        ![](images/wsfb-licenseassign.png)\n\n        Store for Business updates the list of assigned licenses.\n\n    **To reclaim licenses**\n\n    -   Choose the person you want to reclaim the license from, click **Reclaim licenses**, and then click **Reclaim licenses**.\n\n        ![](images/wsfb-licensereclaim.png)\n\n        Store for Business updates the list of assigned licenses.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"download-offline-licensed-apps\"></a>Download offline-licensed app\n\nOffline licensing is a new feature in Windows 10 and allows apps to be deployed to devices that are not connected to the Internet.
