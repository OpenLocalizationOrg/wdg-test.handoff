(MDM)\n\n**Applies to**\n\n-   Windows 10 Mobile\n\n## Summary\nThis article describes how to upgrade eligible Windows Phone 8.1 devices to Windows 10 Mobile using Mobile Device Management (MDM). To determine if the device is eligible for an upgrade, see the [How to determine whether an upgrade is available for a device](#howto-upgrade-available) topic in this article.\n\nThe Windows Phone 8.1 to Windows 10 Mobile upgrade uses an \"opt-in\" or \"seeker\" model. An eligible device must opt-in to be offered the upgrade. For consumers, the Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Advisor app is available from the Windows Store to perform the opt-in. For Enterprises, Microsoft is offering a centralized management solution through MDM that can push a management policy to each eligible device to perform the opt-in.\n\nIf you use a list of allowed applications (app whitelisting) with MDM, verify that system applications are whitelisted before you upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. Also, be aware that there are [known issues](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt299056.aspx#whitelist) with app whitelisting that could adversely affect the device after you upgrade.\n\nSome enterprises might want to control the availability of the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade to their users. With the opt-in model, the enterprise can blacklist the Upgrade Advisor app to prevent their users from upgrading prematurely. For more information about how to blacklist the Upgrade Advisor app, see the [How to blacklist the Upgrade Advisor app](#howto-blacklist) section in this article. Enterprises that have blacklisted the Upgrade Advisor app can use the solution described in this article to select the upgrade timing on a per-device basis.\n\n## More information\n\nTo provide enterprises with a solution that's independent of the Upgrade Advisor, a new registry key in the registry configuration service provider (CSP) is available. A special GUID key value is defined. When Microsoft Update (MU) detects the presence of the registry key value on a device, any available upgrade will be made available to the device.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Windows Phone 8.1 device with an available upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile.\n- Device connected to Wi-Fi or cellular network to perform scan for upgrade.\n- Device is already enrolled with an MDM session.\n- Device is able to receive the management policy.\n- MDM is capable of pushing the management policy to devices. Minimum version numbers for some popular MDM providers that support this solution are: InTune: 5.0.5565, AirWatch: 8.2, Mobile Iron: 9.0.\n\n### Instructions for the MDM server\n\nThe registry CSP is used to push the GUID value to the following registry key for which the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) client has Read/Write access and for which the Device Update service has Read access.\n\n```\n[HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Provisioning\\OMADM] \n\"EnterpriseUpgrade\"=\"d369c9b6-2379-466d-9162-afc53361e3c2”\n```\n\n\nThe complete SyncML command for the solution is as follows. Note: The SyncML may vary, depending on your MDM solution.\n\n```\nSyncML xmlns=\"SYNCML:SYNCML1.1\"> \n  <SyncBody>\n    <Add>\n      <CmdID>250</CmdID>\n      <Item>\n        <Target>\n          <LocURI>./Vendor/MSFT/Registry/HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Provisioning/OMADM/EnterpriseUpgrade</LocURI>\n        </Target>\n        <Meta>\n          <Format xmlns=”syncml:metinf”>chr</Format>\n        </Meta>\n        <Data>d369c9b6-2379-466d-9162-afc53361e3c2</Data>\n      </Item>\n    </Add>\n    <Final/>\n  </SyncBody>\n</SyncML>\n```\n\nThe OMA DM server policy description is provided in the following table:\n\n|Item |Setting |\n|------|------------|\n| OMA-URI  |./Vendor/MSFT/Registry/HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Provisioning/OMADM/EnterpriseUpgrade |\n| Data Type  |String |\n| Value  |d369c9b6-2379-466d-9162-afc53361e3c2 |\n\n\nAfter the device consumes the policy, it will be able to receive an available upgrade.\n\nTo disable the policy, delete the **OMADM** registry key or set the **EnterpriseUpgrade** string value to anything other than the GUID.\n\n### How to determine whether an upgrade is available for a device <a id=\"howto-upgrade-available\"></a>\n\nThe Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Advisor app is not designed or intended for Enterprise customers who want to automate the upgrade process. However, the Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Advisor app is the best mechanism to determine when an upgrade is available. The app dynamically queries whether the upgrade is released for this device model and associated mobile operator (MO).\n\nWe recommend that enterprises use a pilot device with the Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Advisor app installed. The pilot device provides the device model and MO used by the enterprise. When you run the app on the pilot device, it will tell you that either an upgrade is available, that the device is eligible for upgrade, or that an upgrade is not available for this device.\n\nNote: The availability of Windows 10 Mobile as an update for existing Windows Phone 8.1 devices varies by device manufacturer, device model, country or region, mobile operator or service provider, hardware limitations, and other factors. To check for compatibility and other important installation information, see the [Windows 10 mobile](https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/windows10) page.\n\n### How to blacklist the Upgrade Advisor app <a id=\"howto-blacklist\"></a>\n\nSome enterprises may want to block their users from installing the Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Advisor app. With Windows Phone 8.1, you can allow or deny individual apps by adding specific app publishers or the app globally unique identifier (GUID) from the Window Phone Store to an allow or deny XML list. The GUID for a particular application can be found in the URL for the app in the phone store. For example, the GUID to the Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Adviser (fbe47e4f-7769-4103-910e-dca8c43e0b07) is displayed in the following URL:\n\nhttp://windowsphone.com/s?appid=fbe47e4f-7769-4103-910e-dca8c43e0b07\n\nFor more information about how to do this, see [Try it out: restrict Windows Phone 8.1 apps](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn771706.aspx).\n\n## Related topics\n\n[Windows 10 Mobile and mobile device management](..\\manage\\windows-10-mobile-and-mdm.md)\n"}
