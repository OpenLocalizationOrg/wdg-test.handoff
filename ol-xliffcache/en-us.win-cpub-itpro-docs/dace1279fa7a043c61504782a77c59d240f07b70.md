# Use AppLocker and Software Restriction Policies in the same domain

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

This topic for IT professionals describes concepts and procedures to help you manage your application control strategy using Software Restriction Policies and AppLocker.

## Using AppLocker and Software Restriction Policies in the same domain

AppLocker is supported on systems running Windows 7 and above. Software Restriction Policies (SRP) is supported on systems running Windows Vista or earlier. You can continue to use SRP for application control on your pre-Windows 7 computers, but use AppLocker for computers running Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 and later. It is recommended that you author AppLocker and SRP rules in separate GPOs and target the GPO with SRP policies to systems running Windows Vista or earlier. When both SRP and AppLocker policies are applied to computers running Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 and later, the SRP policies are ignored.

The following table compares the features and functions of Software Restriction Policies (SRP) and AppLocker.

<td align="left"><p>SRP works in the “deny list mode” where administrators can create rules for files that they do not want to allow in this Enterprise whereas the rest of the file are allowed to run by default.</p>
<p>SRP can also be configured in the “allow list mode” such that the by default all files are blocked and administrators need to create allow rules for files that they want to allow.</p></td>

<p>Beginning with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, you can only select the file to hash, not provide the hash value.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>AppLocker computes the hash value itself. Internally, it uses the SHA2 Authenticode hash for Portable Executables (exe and dll) and Windows Installers and a SHA2 flat file hash for the rest.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>Support for different security levels</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>With SRP, you can specify the permissions with which an app can run. So, you can configure a rule such that Notepad always runs with restricted permissions and never with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>SRP on Windows Vista and earlier supported multiple security levels. On Windows 7, that list was restricted to just two levels: Disallowed and Unrestricted (Basic User translates to Disallowed).</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>SRP does not support audit mode. The only way to test SRP policies is to set up a test environment and run a few experiments.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>AppLocker supports audit mode which allows you to test the effect of their policy in the real production environment without impacting the user experience. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can start enforcing the policy.</p></td>
