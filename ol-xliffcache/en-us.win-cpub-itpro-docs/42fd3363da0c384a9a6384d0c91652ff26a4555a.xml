The following table contains the list of possible privileges for this event:\n\n| Privilege Name                | User Right Group Policy Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege | Replace a process-level token                                  | Required to assign the [*primary token*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms721603(v=vs.85).aspx#_security_primary_token_gly) of a process. <br>With this privilege, the user can initiate a process to replace the default token associated with a started subprocess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| SeAuditPrivilege              | Generate security audits                                       | With this privilege, the user can add entries to the security log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| SeBackupPrivilege             | Back up files and directories                                  | -   Required to perform backup operations. <br>With this privilege, the user can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system.<br>This privilege causes the system to grant all read access control to any file, regardless of the [*access control list*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms721532(v=vs.85).aspx#_security_access_control_list_gly) (ACL) specified for the file.
