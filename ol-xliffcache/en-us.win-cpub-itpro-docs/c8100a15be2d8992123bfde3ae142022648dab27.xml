For more information about sequencing an application by using a command line, see [How to Sequence a New Application by Using the Command Line](how-to-sequence-a-new-application-by-using-the-command-line.md).\n\n## Sequencer Command-Line Parameters\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-help-or---\"></a>**/HELP or /?**  \nDisplays information about parameters that are available for using a command line to sequence applications.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-installpackage-or--i\"></a>**/INSTALLPACKAGE or /I**  \nSpecifies the Windows Installer or a batch file that will be used to install an application so that it can be sequenced.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-installpath-or--p\"></a>**/INSTALLPATH or /P**  \nSpecifies the package root directory for an application.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-outputfile-or--o\"></a>**/OUTPUTFILE or /O**  \nSpecifies the path and file name of the SPRJ file that will be generated.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-fullload-or--f\"></a>**/FULLLOAD or /F**  \nSpecifies whether all files will be contained in the primary feature block. If the **/FULLLOAD** parameter is specified on the command line, all of the associated application data is added to primary feature block. If the **/FULLLOAD** parameter is not specified on the command line, then none of the associated application data is added to the primary feature block.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-packagename-or--k\"></a>**/PACKAGENAME or /K**  \nSpecifies the package name that will be assigned to the sequenced application.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"-blocksize\"></a>**/BLOCKSIZE**  \nSpecifies the SFT file block size that will be used to stream the package to client computers. You can select one of the following values:\n\n-   4 KB\n\n-   16 KB\n\n-   32 KB\n\n-   64 KB\n\nYou should consider the size of the SFT file when you specify the block size. A file with a smaller block size takes longer to stream over the network but is less bandwidth-intensive.
