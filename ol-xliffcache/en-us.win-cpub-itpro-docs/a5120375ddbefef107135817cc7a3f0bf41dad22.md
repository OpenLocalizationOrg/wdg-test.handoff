# How to Create an Application Group


In the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can use the following procedure to create application groups to organize your applications.

**To create an application group**

1.  In the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, click the **Applications** node in the left pane or expand it and highlight an existing application group.

2.  Right-click the **Applications** node or the existing application group where you want to put the new group, and choose **New Application Group**.

3.  In the **New Application Group Wizard**, type the name for the group and click **OK**.

    Now you can populate the new group by importing applications. You can also move applications between groups. For more information about moving applications, see [How to Move an Application](how-to-move-an-application.md).
