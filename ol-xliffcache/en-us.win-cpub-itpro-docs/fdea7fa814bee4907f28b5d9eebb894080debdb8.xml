Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the account that requested privileged operation.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:\n\n    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO\n\n    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local\n\n    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL\n\n    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.\n\n    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.\n\n-   **Logon ID** \\[Type = HexInt64\\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”\n\n**Service**:\n\n-   **Server** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: contains the name of the Windows subsystem calling the routine. Subsystems examples are:\n\n    -   Security\n\n    -   Security Account Manager\n\n    -   NT Local Security Authority / Authentication Service\n\n    -   SC Manager\n\n    -   Win32 SystemShutdown module\n\n    -   LSA\n\n-   **Service Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\] \\[Optional\\]: supplies a name of the privileged subsystem service or function. For example, \"RESET RUNTIME LOCAL SECURITY\" might be specified by a **Local Security Authority** service used to update the local security policy database or **LsaRegisterLogonProcess()** might be specified by a **NT Local Security Authority / Authentication Service** used to register new logon process.\n\n**Process:**\n\n-   **Process ID** \\[Type = Pointer\\]: hexadecimal Process ID of the process that attempted to call the privileged service. Process ID (PID) is a number used by the operating system to uniquely identify an active process. To see the PID for a specific process you can, for example, use Task Manager (Details tab, PID column):\n\n    <img src=\"images/task-manager.png\" alt=\"Task manager illustration\" width=\"585\" height=\"375\" />\n\n    If you convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, you can compare it to the values in Task Manager.\n\n    You can also correlate this process ID with a process ID in other events, for example, “[4688](event-4688.md): A new process has been created” **Process Information\\\\New Process ID**.\n\n-   **Process Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** full path and the name of the executable for the process.\n\n**Service Request Information**:\n\n-   **Privileges** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the list of user privileges which were requested. The possible privileges depend on the subcategory, either **Audit Non Sensitive Privilege Use** or **Audit Sensitive Privilege Use**, as shown in the following two tables:\n\n| **Subcategory of event**          | **Privilege Name: <br>User Right Group Policy Name**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Audit Non Sensitive Privilege Use | **SeChangeNotifyPrivilege: <br>**Bypass traverse checking                              | Required to receive notifications of changes to files or directories.

With this privilege, the user can use a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. Exercising this privilege could significantly affect system performance by decreasing the amount of available random access memory (RAM).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Audit Sensitive Privilege Use | **SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege: <br>**Modify firmware environment values                            | Required to modify the nonvolatile RAM of systems that use this type of memory to store configuration information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Audit Sensitive Privilege Use | **SeTcbPrivilege: <br>**Act as part of the operating system                                         | This privilege identifies its holder as part of the trusted computer base.

The user or object that is granted this privilege must have write access to the account control flags on the user or computer object. A server process running on a computer (or under a user context) that is trusted for delegation can access resources on another computer using the delegated credentials of a client, as long as the account of the client does not have the **Account cannot be delegated** account control flag set. |\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4673(S, F): A privileged service was called.\n\n> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).\n\n-   Monitor for this event where “**Subject\\\\Security ID**” is *not* one of these well-known security principals: LOCAL SYSTEM, NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, and where “**Subject\\\\Security ID**” is not an administrative account that is expected to have the listed **Privileges**. Especially monitor Failure events.\n\n-   If you need to monitor events related to specific Windows subsystems (“**Service\\\\Server**”), for example **NT Local Security Authority / Authentication Service** or **Security Account Manager**, monitor this event for the corresponding “**Service\\\\Server**.”\n\n-   If you need to monitor events related to specific Windows security services or functions (“**Service\\\\Service Name**”), for example **LsaRegisterLogonProcess()**, monitor this event for the corresponding “**Service\\\\Service Name**.”\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   If you have a pre-defined “**Process Name**” for the process reported in this event, monitor all events with “**Process Name**” not equal to your defined value.\n\n-   You can monitor to see if “**Process Name**” is not in a standard folder (for example, not in **System32** or **Program Files**) or is in a restricted folder (for example, **Temporary Internet Files**).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   If you have a pre-defined list of restricted substrings or words in process names (for example, “**mimikatz**” or “**cain.exe**”), check for these substrings in “**Process Name**.”\n\n-   For a specific “**Subject\\\\Security ID**,” if there is a defined list of allowed privileges, monitor for “**Privileges**” that it should not be able to use.\n\n-   If you have a list of specific user rights which should never be used, or used only by a few accounts (for example, SeDebugPrivilege), trigger an alert for those “**Privileges**.”\n\n-   If you have a list of specific user rights for which every use must be reported or monitored (for example, SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege), trigger an alert for those “**Privileges**.”\n\n"}
