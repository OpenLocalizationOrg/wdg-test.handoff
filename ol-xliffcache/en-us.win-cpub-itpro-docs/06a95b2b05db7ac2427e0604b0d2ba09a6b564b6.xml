Application Report** screen. You can alternatively use the **&lt;Application\\_Name&gt;** dialog box. The procedure is the same for setting deployment status on the report for websites.\n\n \n\n**To change the deployment status of an application**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click the application name.\n\n2.  On the **Actions** menu, click **Set Deployment Status**.\n\n3.  Select one of the following options:\n\n    -   **Not Reviewed** (default)\n\n    -   **Testing**\n\n    -   **Mitigating**\n\n    -   **Ready to Deploy**\n\n    -   **Will Not Deploy**\n\n4.  Click **OK**.\n\n## Filtering By Deployment Status\n\n\nYou can filter your applications and websites by your deployment status.\n\n**To filter based on deployment status**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click **Toggle Filter**.\n\n    The **Query Builder** appears with a blank row.\n\n2.  In the **Query Builder**, enter your filter criteria, pressing the Tab key to add clauses.\n\n    For example, the following query filters for applications with a deployment status of **Mitigating** or **Ready to Deploy**.\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">And/Or</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Field</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Operator</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>And</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Deployment Status</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Equals</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Mitigating</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Or</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Deployment Status</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Equals</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Ready to Deploy</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n    To delete a clause, right-click the row, and then click **Delete Clause**.\n\n3.
