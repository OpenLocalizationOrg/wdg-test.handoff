# Select Files Page


Use the **Select Files** page to review the files that will be saved with the Package Accelerator. Some of these files are displayed because they were not located on the specified media or on the local computer. In some scenarios the displayed files should be saved with the Package Accelerator so that the virtual application package can be fully recreated when the Package Accelerator is applied.

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="select-files-pane"></a>**Select Files Pane**  
Displays a list of the files that were discovered in the Package Accelerator. Carefully review the files, and clear any file that should be removed from the Package Accelerator. Select only files that are required by the application to run successfully.
