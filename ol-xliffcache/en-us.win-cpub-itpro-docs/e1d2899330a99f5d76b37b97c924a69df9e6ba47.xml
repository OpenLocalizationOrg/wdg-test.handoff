Windows 10\n\nDetermines whether to audit each instance of a user logging on to or logging off from another device in which this device is used to validate the account.\n\nThis security setting determines whether to audit each instance of a user logging on to or logging off from another computer in which this computer is used to validate the account. Account logon events are generated when a domain user account is authenticated on a domain controller. The event is logged in the domain controller's security log. Logon events are generated when a local user is authenticated on a local computer. The event is logged in the local security log. Account logoff events are not generated.\n\nIf you define this policy setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, audit failures, or not audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when an account logon attempt succeeds. Failure audits generate an audit entry when an account logon attempt fails.\nTo set this value to **No auditing**, in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the **Define these policy settings** check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.\n\n**Default**: Success\n\n## Configure this audit setting\n\nYou can configure this security setting by opening the appropriate policy under Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Audit Policy.\n\n| Logon events | Description                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 672          | An authentication service (AS) ticket was successfully issued and validated.                                                         |\n| 673          | A ticket granting service (TGS) ticket was granted.                                                                                  |\n| 674          | A security principal renewed an AS ticket or TGS ticket.                                                                             |\n| 675          | Preauthentication failed.
