MBAM 1.0\n\n\nBefore you deploy Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) into a production environment, you should evaluate it in a lab environment. You can use the information in this topic to set up MBAM in a single server lab environment for evaluation purposes only.\n\nWhile the actual deployment steps are very similar to the scenario that is described in [How to Install and Configure MBAM on a Single Server](how-to-install-and-configure-mbam-on-a-single-server-mbam-1.md), this topic contains additional information to enable you to set up an MBAM evaluation environment in the least amount of time.\n\n## Set up the Lab Environment\n\n\nEven when you set up a non-production instance of MBAM to evaluate in a lab environment, you should still verify that you have met the deployment prerequisites and the hardware and software requirements. For more information, see [MBAM 1.0 Deployment Prerequisites](mbam-10-deployment-prerequisites.md) and [MBAM 1.0 Supported Configurations](mbam-10-supported-configurations.md).

the frequency settings on the MBAM Client status reporting by using Registry Editor. However, these modifications should be used for testing purposes only.\n\n**Warning**  \nThis topic describes how to change the Windows registry by using Registry Editor. If you change the Windows registry incorrectly, you can cause serious problems that might require you to reinstall Windows. You should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you change the registry. Microsoft cannot guarantee that the problems that might occur when you change the registry can be resolved. Change the registry at your own risk.\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"modify-the-frequency-settings-on-mbam-client-status-reporting-\"></a>Modify the Frequency Settings on MBAM Client Status Reporting\n\nThe MBAM Client wakeup and status reporting frequencies have a minimum value of 90 minutes when they are set to use Group Policy. You can change these frequencies on MBAM client computers by editing the Windows registry to lower values, which will help speed up the testing. To modify the frequency settings on MBAM Client status reporting, use a registry editor to navigate to **HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Policies\\\\FVE\\\\MDOPBitLockerManagement**, change the values for **ClientWakeupFrequency** and **StatusReportingFrequency** to **1** as the minimum client supported value, and then restart BitLocker Management Client Service. When you make this change, the MBAM Client will report every minute. You can set values this low only when you do so manually in the registry.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"modify-the-startup-delay-on-mbam-client-service-\"></a>Modify the Startup Delay on MBAM Client Service\n\nIn addition to the MBAM Client wakeup and status reporting frequencies, there is a random delay of up to 90 minutes when the MBAM Client agent service starts on client computers. If you do not want the random delay, create a **DWORD** value of **NoStartupDelay** under **HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MBAM**, set its value to **1**, and then restart BitLocker Management Client Service.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Getting Started with MBAM 1.0](getting-started-with-mbam-10.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
