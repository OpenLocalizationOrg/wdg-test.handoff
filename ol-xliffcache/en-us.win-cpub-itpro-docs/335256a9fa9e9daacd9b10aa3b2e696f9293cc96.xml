Windows 10\n\nThis security policy reference topic for the IT professional describes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the **Profile system performance** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis security setting determines which users can use Windows performance monitoring tools to monitor the performance of system processes.\n\nConstant: SeSystemProfilePrivilege\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   User-defined list of accounts\n-   Administrators\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Ensure that only the local Administrators group is assigned the **Profile system performance** user right.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\User Rights Assignment\n\n### Default values\n\nBy default this setting is Administrators on domain controllers and on stand-alone servers.\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default policy values for the most recent supported versions of Windows. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Administrators| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Administrators| \n| Domain Controller Effective Default Settings | Administrators| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Administrators| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Administrators| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features, tools, and guidance to help you manage this policy.\n\nA restart of the device is not required for this policy setting to be effective.\n\nAny change to the user rights assignment for an account becomes effective the next time the owner of the account logs on.\n\nDepending on your version of Windows and your environment, you might need to add this user right to the Local System account or the Local Service account if you encounter access errors when you use the Administrators account.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nSettings are applied in the following order through a Group Policy Object (GPO), which will overwrite settings on the local computer at the next Group Policy update:\n\n1.  Local policy settings\n2.  Site policy settings\n3.  Domain policy settings\n4.  OU policy settings\n\nWhen a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nThe **Profile system performance** user right poses a moderate vulnerability. Attackers with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes that they might want to attack directly. Attackers might also be able to determine what processes are active on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures to avoid, such as anti-virus software or an intrusion detection system.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nEnsure that only the local Administrators group is assigned the **Profile system performance** user right.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nNone. Restricting the **Profile system performance** user right to the local Administrators group is the default configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [User Rights Assignment](user-rights-assignment.md)\n"}
