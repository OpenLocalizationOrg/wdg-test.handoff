Success audits generate an audit entry when the exercise of a user right succeeds. Failure audits generate an audit entry when the exercise of a user right fails.\n\nTo set this value to **No auditing**, in the **Properties** dialog box for this policy setting, select the Define these policy settings check box and clear the **Success** and **Failure** check boxes.\n\n**Default:** No auditing.\n\nAudits are not generated for use of the following user rights, even if success audits or failure audits are specified for **Audit privilege use**. Enabling auditing of these user rights tend to generate many events in the security log which may impede your computer's performance. To audit the following user rights, enable the **FullPrivilegeAuditing** registry key.\n\n-   Bypass traverse checking\n-   Debug programs\n-   Create a token object\n-   Replace process level token\n-   Generate security audits\n-   Back up files and directories\n-   Restore files and directories\n\n## Configure this audit setting\n\nYou can configure this security setting under Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Audit Policy.\n\n| Privilege use events | Description |\n| - | - |\n| 576 | Specified privileges were added to a user's access token.<br>**Note:**  This event is generated when the user logs on.|\n| 577 | A user attempted to perform a privileged system service operation. |\n| 578 | Privileges were used on an already open handle to a protected object. | \n \n## Related topics\n\n- [Basic security audit policy settings](basic-security-audit-policy-settings.md)\n \n \n"}
