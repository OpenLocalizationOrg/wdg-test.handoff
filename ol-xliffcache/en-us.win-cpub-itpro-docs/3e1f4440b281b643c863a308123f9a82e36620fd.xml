allows you to audit events generated by changes to the [Windows Filtering Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx) (WFP), such as the following:\n\n-   IPsec services status.\n\n-   Changes to IPsec policy settings.\n\n-   Changes to Windows Filtering Platform Base Filtering Engine policy settings.\n\n-   Changes to WFP providers and engine.\n\nWindows Filtering Platform (WFP) enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to filter and modify TCP/IP packets, monitor or authorize connections, filter Internet Protocol security (IPsec)-protected traffic, and filter remote procedure calls (RPCs).\n\nThis subcategory is outside the scope of this document.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger
