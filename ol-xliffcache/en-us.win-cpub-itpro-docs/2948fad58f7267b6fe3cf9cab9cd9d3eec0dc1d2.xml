As of Windows 10, event 4703 is also logged by applications or services that dynamically adjust token privileges. An example of such an application is System Center Configuration Manager, which makes WMI queries at recurring intervals and quickly generates a large number of 4703 events (with the WMI activity listed as coming from svchost.exe). If you are using an application or system service that makes changes to system privileges through the AdjustPrivilegesToken API, you might need to disable Success auditing for this subcategory (Audit Authorization Policy Change), or work with a very high volume of event 4703.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.\n\nToken privileges provide the ability to take certain system-level actions that you only need to do at particular moments. For example, anybody can restart a computer, but the operating system doesn’t enable that privilege by default. Instead, the privilege is enabled when you click **Shutdown**. You can check the current state of the user’s token privileges using the **whoami /priv** command:\n\n<img src=\"images/whoami-privilege-list.png\" alt=\"Whoami privilege list illustration\" width=\"1147\" height=\"475\" />\n\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n***Event XML:***\n```\n- <Event xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event\">\n- <System>\n <Provider Name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing\" Guid=\"{54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D}\" /> \n <EventID>4703</EventID> \n <Version>0</Version> \n <Level>0</Level> \n <Task>13570</Task> \n <Opcode>0</Opcode> \n <Keywords>0x8020000000000000</Keywords> \n <TimeCreated SystemTime=\"2015-11-12T20:49:46.365958700Z\" /> \n <EventRecordID>5245</EventRecordID> \n <Correlation /> \n <Execution ProcessID=\"4\" ThreadID=\"3632\" /> \n <Channel>Security</Channel> \n <Computer>WIN-GG82ULGC9GO.contoso.local</Computer> \n <Security /> \n </System>\n- <EventData>\n <Data Name=\"SubjectUserSid\">S-1-5-18</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectUserName\">WIN-GG82ULGC9GO$</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectDomainName\">CONTOSO</Data> \n <Data Name=\"SubjectLogonId\">0x3e7</Data> \n <Data Name=\"TargetUserSid\">S-1-5-18</Data> \n <Data Name=\"TargetUserName\">WIN-GG82ULGC9GO$</Data> \n <Data Name=\"TargetDomainName\">CONTOSO</Data> \n <Data Name=\"TargetLogonId\">0x3e7</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ProcessName\">C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\svchost.exe</Data> \n <Data Name=\"ProcessId\">0x270</Data> \n <Data Name=\"EnabledPrivilegeList\">SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege SeSecurityPrivilege SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege SeLoadDriverPrivilege SeSystemtimePrivilege SeBackupPrivilege SeRestorePrivilege SeShutdownPrivilege SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege SeUndockPrivilege SeManageVolumePrivilege</Data> \n <Data Name=\"DisabledPrivilegeList\">-</Data> \n </EventData>\n</Event>\n\n```\n\n***Required Server Roles:*** None.\n\n***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2016, Windows 10.\n\n***Event Versions:*** 0.\n\n***Field Descriptions:***\n\n**Subject:**\n\n-   **Security ID** \\[Type = SID\\]**:** SID of account that requested the “enable” or “disable” operation for **Target Account** privileges.

Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group.

Here is the list of possible user rights:\n\n| Privilege Name                  | User Right Group Policy Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege   | Replace a process-level token                                  | Required to assign the [*primary token*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms721603(v=vs.85).aspx#_security_primary_token_gly) of a process. <br>With this privilege, the user can initiate a process to replace the default token associated with a started subprocess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| SeAuditPrivilege                | Generate security audits                                       | With this privilege, the user can add entries to the security log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| SeBackupPrivilege               | Back up files and directories                                  | -   Required to perform backup operations. <br>With this privilege, the user can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system.<br>This privilege causes the system to grant all read access control to any file, regardless of the [*access control list*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms721532(v=vs.85).aspx#_security_access_control_list_gly) (ACL) specified for the file.

See possible values in the table above.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 4703(S): A user right was adjusted.\n\nAs of Windows 10, event 4703 is generated by applications or services that dynamically adjust token privileges. An example of such an application is System Center Configuration Manager, which makes WMI queries at recurring intervals and quickly generates a large number of 4703 events (with the WMI activity listed as coming from svchost.exe). If you are using an application or system service that makes changes to system privileges through the AdjustPrivilegesToken API, you might need to disable Success auditing for this subcategory, [Audit Authorization Policy Change](audit-authorization-policy-change.md), or work with a very high volume of event 4703.\n\nOtherwise, see the recommendations in the following table.\n\n| **Type of monitoring required**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Recommendation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **High-value accounts**: You might have high-value domain or local accounts for which you need to monitor each action.<br>Examples of high-value accounts are database administrators, built-in local administrator account, domain administrators, service accounts, domain controller accounts and so on. | Monitor this event with the **“Subject\\\\Security ID”** that corresponds to the high-value account or accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| **Anomalies or malicious actions**: You might have specific requirements for detecting anomalies or monitoring potential malicious actions.
