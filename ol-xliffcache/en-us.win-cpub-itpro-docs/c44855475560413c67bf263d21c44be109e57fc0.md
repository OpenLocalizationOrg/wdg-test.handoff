**Note**<br>Each desktop edition in the table also has an N and KN edition. These editions have had media-related functionality removed. Devices with N or KN editions installed can be upgraded to corresponding N or KN editions using the same methods.

## Upgrade using mobile device management (MDM)
- To upgrade desktop editions of Windows 10 using MDM, you'll need to enter the product key for the upgraded edition in the **UpgradeEditionWithProductKey** policy setting of the **WindowsLicensing** CSP. For more info, see [WindowsLicensing CSP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=690907).

- To upgrade mobile editions of Windows 10 using MDM, you'll need to enter the product key for the upgraded edition in the **UpgradeEditionWithLicense** policy setting of the **WindowsLicensing** CSP. For more info, see [WindowsLicensing CSP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=690907).

## Upgrade using a provisioning package
The Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) tool is included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10. [Install the ADK.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526740)

- To use Windows ICD to create a provisioning package for upgrading desktop editions of Windows 10, go to **Runtime settings &gt; EditionUpgrade &gt; UpgradeEditionWithProductKey** in the **Available customizations** panel in Windows ICD and enter the product key for the upgraded edition.

## Upgrade using a command-line tool
You can run the changepk.exe command-line tool to upgrade devices to a supported edition of Windows 10:

## Upgrade by manually entering a product key

2.  Click **Change product key**.

**To upgrade through the Windows Store**

1.  From either the **Start** menu or the **Start** screen, type 'Activation' and click on the Activation shortcut.

2.  Click **Go to Store**.
