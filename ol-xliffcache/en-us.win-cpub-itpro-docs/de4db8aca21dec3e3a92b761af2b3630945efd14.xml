your Microsoft Surface Hub with either the [Office 365 UI](#create-device-acct-o365) or the [Exchange Admin Center](#create-device-acct-eac).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-o365\"></a>Create a device account using Office 365\n\n\n1.  [Create the account in the Office 365 Admin Center](#create-device-acct-o365-admin-ctr).\n2.  [Create a mobile device mailbox (ActiveSync) policy from the Microsoft Exchange Admin Center](#create-device-acct-o365-mbx-policy).\n3.  [Use PowerShell to complete device account creation](#create-device-acct-o365-complete-acct).\n4.  [Use PowerShell to configure Exchange properties of the account](#create-device-acct-o365-configure-exch-prop).\n5.  [Enable the account with Skype for Business](#create-device-acct-o365-skype-for-business).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-o365-admin-ctr\"></a>Create the account in the Office 365 Admin Center\n\n1.  Sign in to Office 365 by visiting http://portal.office.com/admin/\n2.  Provide the admin credentials for your Office 365 tenant. This will take you to your Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n    ![office 365 admin center. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-02.png)\n\n3.  Once you are at the Office 365 Admin Center, navigate to **Users** in the left panel, and then click **Active Users**.\n\n    ![office 365 admin center dashboard shwoing active users.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-03.png)\n\n4.  On the controls above the list of users, click **+** to create a new user. You'll need to enter a **Display name**, **User name**, **Password** and an email address for the recipient of the password. Optionally you can change the password manually, but we recommend that you use the auto-generated option. You also need to assign this account a license that gives the account access to Exchange and Skype for Business services.\n\n    ![screen to create a new user account. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-04.png)\n\n    Click **Create**.\n\n5.  Once the account has been successfully created, click **Close** on the resulting dialog box, and you will see the admin center Active Users list again.\n\n    ![confirmation screen for creating a new account. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-05.png)\n\n6.  Select the user you just created from the **Active Users** list. You need to disable the Skype for Business license, because you can’t create a Skype Meeting Room with this option.\n\n    ![office 365 admin center showing properties for the new user account. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-06.png)\n\n    In the right panel you can see the account properties and several optional actions. The process so far has created a regular Skype account for this user, which you need to disable. Click **Edit** for the **Assigned license** section, then click the dropdown arrow next to the license to expand the details.\n\n    ![assign license for skype for business online.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-07.png)\n\n    From the list, uncheck **Skype for Business Online (plan 2)** (this license may vary depending on your organization), and click **SAVE**.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-o365-mbx-policy\"></a>Create a mobile device mailbox (ActiveSync) policy from the Exchange Admin Center\n\n1.  In the Office 365 Admin Center’s left panel, click **ADMIN**, and then click **Exchange**.\n\n    ![office 365 admin center, showing exchange active users. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-08.png)\n\n2.  This will open another tab on your browser to take you to the Exchange Admin Center, where you can create and set the Mailbox Setting for Surface Hub.\n\n    ![exchange admin center. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-09.png)\n\n3.  To create a Mobile Device Mailbox Policy, click **Mobile** from the left panel and then click **Mobile device mailbox policies**. Surface Hubs require an account with a mobile device mailbox policy that does not require a password, so if you already have an existing policy that matches this requirement, you can apply that policy to the account. Otherwise use the following steps to create a new one to be used only for Surface Hub device accounts.\n\n    ![excahnge admin center - creating a mobile device mailbox policy. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-10.png)\n\n4.  To create a New Surface Hub mobile device mailbox policy, click the **+** button from the controls above the list of policies to add a new policy. For the name, provide a name that will help you distinguish this policy from other device accounts (for example, *SurfaceHubDeviceMobilePolicy*). Make sure the policy does not require a password for the devices assigned to, so make sure **Require a Password** remains unchecked, then click **Save**.\n\n    ![image showing new mobile device policy](images/setupdeviceaccto365-11.png)\n\n5.  After you have created the new mobile device mailbox policy, go back to the **Exchange Admin Center** and you will see the new policy listed.\n\n    ![image with new mobile device mailbox policy in exchange admin center. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-12.png)\n\n6.  Now, to apply the ActiveSync policy without using PowerShell, you can do the following: In the EAC, click **Recipients** &gt; **Mailboxes** and then select a mailbox.\n\n    ![image showing mailbox in exchange admin center. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-13.png)\n\n7.  In the Details pane, scroll to **Phone and Voice Features** and click **View details** to display the **Mobile Device Details** screen.\n\n    ![image showing mobile device details for the mailbox. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-14.png)\n\n8.  The mobile device mailbox policy that’s currently assigned is displayed. To change the mobile device mailbox policy, click **Browse**.\n\n    ![image with details for the mobile device policy. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-15.png)\n\n9.  Choose the appropriate mobile device mailbox policy from the list, click **OK** and then click **Save**.\n\n    ![image showing multiple mobile device mailbox policies. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-16.png)\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-o365-complete-acct\"></a>Use PowerShell to complete device account creation\n\nFrom here on, you'll need to finish the account creation process using PowerShell to set up some configuration.\n\nIn order to run cmdlets used by these PowerShell scripts, the following must be installed for the admin PowerShell console:\n\n-   [Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals BETA](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=718149)\n-   [Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236297)\n-   [Skype for Business Online, Windows PowerShell Module](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39366)\n\n### Connecting to online services\n\n1.  Run Windows PowerShell as Administrator.\n\n    ![image showing how to start windows powershell and run as administrator. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-17.png)\n\n2.  Create a Credentials object, then create a new session that connects to Skype for Business Online, and provide the global tenant administrator account, then click **OK**.\n\n    ![image for windows powershell credential request. ](images/setupdeviceaccto365-18.png)\n\n3.  To connect to Microsoft Online Services, run:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Connect-MsolService -Credential $Cred\n    ```\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-19.png)\n\n4.  Now to connect to Skype for Business Online Services, run:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    $sfbsession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $cred\n    ```\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-20.png)\n\n5.  Finally, to connect to Exchange Online Services, run:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    $exchangeSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri\n    \"https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/\" -Credential $cred -Authentication \"Basic\" –AllowRedirection\n    ```\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-21.png)\n\n6.  Now you have to import the Skype for Business Online Session and the Exchange Online session you have just created, which will import the Exchange and Skype Commands so you can use them locally.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Import-PSSession $exchangesession -AllowClobber -WarningAction SilentlyContinue\n    Import-PSSession $sfbsession -AllowClobber -WarningAction SilentlyContinue\n    ```\n\n    Note that this could take a while to complete.\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-22.png)\n\n7.  Once you’re connected to the online services you need to run a few more cmdlets to configure this account as a Surface Hub device account.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-o365-configure-exch-prop\"></a>Use PowerShell to configure Exchange properties of the account\n\nNow that you're connected to the online services, you can finish setting up the device account. You'll use the device account email address to:\n\n-   Change the mailbox type from regular to room.\n-   Set the password and enable the room mailbox account\n-   Change various Exchange properties\n-   Set the user account password to never expire.\n\n1.  You’ll need to enter the account’s mail address and create a variable with that value:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    $mailbox = (Get-Mailbox <your device account’s alias>)\n    ```\n\n    To store the value get it from the mailbox:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    $strEmail = $mailbox.WindowsEmailAddress\n    ```\n\n    Print the value:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    $strEmail\n    ```\n\n    You will see the correct email address.\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-23.png)\n\n2.  You need to convert the account into to a room mailbox, so run:\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-24.png)\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Set-Mailbox $strEmail -Type Room\n    ```\n\n3.  In order for the device account to be authenticated on a Surface Hub, you need to enable the room mailbox account and set a password, so the account can be used by the device to get meeting information using ActiveSync and log in to Skype for Business.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Set-Mailbox $strEmail -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString  -String \"<your password>\" -AsPlainText -Force) -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true\n    ```\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-25.png)\n\n4.  Various Exchange properties can be set on the device account to improve the meeting experience. You can see which properties need to be set in the [Exchange properties](exchange-properties-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) section.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $acctUpn -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false –AllowConflicts   $false –DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false\n    Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $acctUpn -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse \"This is a <tla rid=\"surface_hub\"/> room!\"\n    ```\n\n    ![image showing powershell cmdlet.](images/setupdeviceaccto365-26.png)\n\n5.  If you decide to have the password not expire, you can set that with PowerShell cmdlets too. See [Password management](password-management-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) for more information.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $strEmail -PasswordNeverExpires $True\n    ```\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-o365-skype-for-business\"></a>Enable the account with Skype for Business\n\nEnable the device account with Skype for Business.\n\nIn order to enable Skype for Business, your environment will need to meet the following prerequisites:\n\n-   You'll need to have Lync Online (Plan 2) or higher in your O365 plan. The plan needs to support conferencing capability.\n-   If you need Enterprise Voice (PSTN telephony) using telephony service providers for the Surface Hub, you need Lync Online (Plan 3).\n-   Your tenant users must have Exchange mailboxes.\n-   Your Surface Hub account does require a Lync Online (Plan 2) or Lync Online (Plan 3) license, but it does not require an Exchange Online license.\n\n1.  Start by creating a remote PowerShell session from a PC.\n\n    ```PowerShell\n    Import-Module LyncOnlineConnector  \n    $cssess=New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $cred  \n    Import-PSSession $cssess -AllowClobber\n    ```\n\n2.  To enable your Surface Hub account for Skype for Business Server, run this cmdlet:\n\n    ```PowerShell\n    Enable-CsMeetingRoom -Identity $rm -RegistrarPool  \n    \"sippoolbl20a04.infra.lync.com\" -SipAddressType EmailAddress\n    ```\n\n    If you aren't sure what value to use for the `RegistrarPool` parameter in your environment, you can get the value from an existing Skype for Business user using this cmdlet:\n\n    ```PowerShell\n    Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity ‘alice@contoso.microsoft.com’| fl *registrarpool*\n    ```\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"create-device-acct-eac\"></a>Create a device account using the Exchange Admin Center\n\n\nYou can use the Exchange Admin Center to create a device account:\n\n1.
