When you install the App-V client using the setup.exe program, the installer determines which prerequisite software is needed and installs it automatically before it installs the client.\n\n**To install the Application Virtualization Client by Using Setup.exe**\n\n1.  Make sure you are logged on with an account that has administrator rights on the computer.\n\n2.  Open a Command Prompt window, and then change the directory to the folder that contains the setup files. When installing version 4.6 or a later version of the App-V client, you must use the correct installer for the computer’s operating system, 32-bit or 64-bit. The installation will fail and an error message will be displayed if you use the wrong installer.\n\n3.  Enter the install command string at the command prompt. Alternatively, you can create a command file and run it from the command prompt. You can also use a scripting language such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell to run the command.\n\n4.  The following command-line example shows how setup.exe can be used with a number of optional parameters. For more information about these parameters, see [Application Virtualization Client Installer Command-Line Parameters](application-virtualization-client-installer-command-line-parameters.md).\n\n    **\"setup.exe\" /s /v\"/qn SWICACHESIZE=\\\\\"10240\\\\\" SWIPUBSVRDISPLAY=\\\\\"Production System\\\\\" SWIPUBSVRTYPE=\\\\\"HTTP /secure\\\\\" SWIPUBSVRHOST=\\\\\"PRODSYS\\\\\" SWIPUBSVRPORT=\\\\\"443\\\\\" SWIPUBSVRPATH=\\\\\"/AppVirt/appsntype.xml\\\\\" SWIPUBSVRREFRESH=\\\\\"on\\\\\" SWIGLOBALDATA=\\\\\"D:\\\\AppVirt\\\\Global\\\\\" SWIUSERDATA=\\\\\"^% LOCALAPPDATA ^%\\\\Windows\\\\Application Virtualization Client\\\\\" SWIFSDRIVE=\\\\\"Q\\\\\"\"**\n\n    **Important**  \n    -   The quotation marks that appear in the \"**/v**\" section must be treated as special characters and entered with a preceding \"**\\\\**\". The quotation marks are required only when the value contains a space; however, for consistency, all the instances in the preceding example are shown as having quotation marks.\n\n    -   The \"**%**\" characters in \"**%HomeDrive%**\" must be preceded by the \"**^**\" escape character. Otherwise, the Windows command shell sets the value to that of the user who is performing the installation.\n\n    -   The **InstallShield** switches **/s** and **/qn** are needed to make this a silent install. The **/qn** switch must follow the **/v** switch, separated by only a quote character with no intervening spaces.\n\n    -   The folder specified in the **SWIGLOBALDATA** value must already exist.\n\n     \n\n5.  When the installation is complete, we recommend that you run a Microsoft Update scan to ensure the latest updates are installed.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Install the Client by Using the Command Line](how-to-install-the-client-by-using-the-command-line-new.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
