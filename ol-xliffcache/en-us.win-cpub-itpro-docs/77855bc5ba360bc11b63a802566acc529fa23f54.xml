It is recommended to first create a test image and test it on MED-V client before deploying it.\n\nWhen creating a MED-V image, it goes through the following stages:\n\n1.  **Local test image**—A basic image that can be tested locally.\n\n2.  **Local packed image**—After the image is tested, the image is packed as it existed prior to testing. No changes made during testing are included in the packed image.\n\n3.  **Packed image on server**—The packed image is uploaded to the server.\n\n## How to Create a MED-V Test Image\n\n\n**To create a new MED-V test image**\n\n1.  Click the **Images** management button.\n\n    The **Images** module appears.\n\n    -   The **Images** module consists of the following panes:\n\n        -   **Local Test Images**—Local unpacked images.\n\n        -   **Local Packed Images**—All packed images on the local computer.\n\n        -   **Packed Images on Server**—All images that have been packed and uploaded to the server.\n\n    -   In the **Local Packed Images** and **Packed Images on Server** panes, the most recent version of each image is displayed as the parent node. Click the parent node to view all other existing versions of the image.\n\n2.  In the **Local Test Images** pane, click **New**.\n\n3.  On the **Test Image Creation** dialog box, select the virtual machine image that you want to configure as a MED-V test image by doing one of the following:\n\n    -   In the **Base image** file field, type the full path to the directory where the Microsoft Virtual PC image prepared for MED-V is located.\n\n    -   Click **Browse** to browse to the directory where the Microsoft Virtual PC image prepared for MED-V is located.\n\n4.  In the **Image name** field, type or select the desired name.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The following characters cannot be included in the image name: space \" &lt; &gt; | \\\\ / : \\* ?\n\n     \n\n5.  Click **OK**.\n\n    A new MED-V test image is created on your host computer with the properties defined in the following table.\n\n    For more information about configuring the MED-V workspace image, refer to [Configuring MED-V Workspace Policies](configuring-med-v-workspace-policies.md).\n\n**Local Test Images Properties**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Property</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Image Name</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The name of the test image as it was defined when the administrator created the image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Image Path</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The local path of the test image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Created</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The date the test image was created.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## How to Test a MED-V Image from the MED-V Client\n\n\nAfter a MED-V test image is created, use the following procedure to test the image locally.\n\n**To test a MED-V image**\n\n1.  Click the **Policy** management button.\n\n2.  In the **Policy** module, assign the MED-V test image to a MED-V workspace by doing the following:\n\n    1.  Click the **Virtual Machine** tab.\n\n    2.  In the **Assigned Image** field, select the MED-V test image you created. If your test image is not in the list, click **Refresh**.\n\n    3.  On the toolbar, click **Save changes**.\n\n3.  Configure any other MED-V workspace settings to be tested. For more information, see [Configuring MED-V Workspace Policies](configuring-med-v-workspace-policies.md).\n\n4.  Start MED-V client.\n\n5.  In the **Confirm Running Test** confirmation box, click **Use Test Image**.\n\n6.  Test the MED-V workspace test image.\n\n    For information about starting and running MED-V client, see [MED-V Client Operations](med-v-client-operations.md).\n\n**Note**  \nWhile testing an image, do not open VPC and make changes to the image.\n\n \n\n**Note**  \nWhen testing an image, no changes are saved to the image between sessions; instead, they are saved in a separate, temporary file. This is to ensure that when the image is packed and run on the production environment, it is the original, clean image.\n\n \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Creating a Virtual PC Image for MED-V](creating-a-virtual-pc-image-for-med-v.md)\n\n[Creating a MED-V Workspace](creating-a-med-v-workspacemedv-10-sp1.md)\n\n[Configuring MED-V Workspace Policies](configuring-med-v-workspace-policies.md)\n\n[MED-V Client Operations](med-v-client-operations.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
