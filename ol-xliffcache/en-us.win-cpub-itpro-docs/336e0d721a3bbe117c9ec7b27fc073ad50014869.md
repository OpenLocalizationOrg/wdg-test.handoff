# How to Export a Report


The process for exporting a report, using the Application Virtualization Console, is the same regardless of the report type.

**To export a report**

1.  Right-click the report displayed in the **Results** pane, and select **Export** from the drop down menu.

2.  Select the report type from the list of types.

3.  In the **Save As** dialog box, navigate to the location where you want to save the output.

4.  Enter a name for the report in the **File Name** field, or select a file from the drop-down list of files.

5.  Select an output type from the **Save as Type** drop-down list of types.

6.  Click the **Save** button to save the file.
