WMI and PowerShell commands allow you to restore application and Windows settings to the settings values that were on the computer the first time the application launched after the UE-V Agent was installed. This restoring action is performed on a per-application or Windows settings basis. The settings are restored the next time that the application is run or when the user logs on to the operating system.\n\n**To restore application settings and Windows settings with PowerShell**\n\n1.  Open the Windows PowerShell window. To import the Microsoft UE-V PowerShell module, enter the following command:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Import-module UEV\n    ```\n\n2.  Enter the following PowerShell cmdlet to restore the application settings and Windows settings.\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\"><strong>PowerShell cmdlet</strong></th>\n    <th align=\"left\"><strong>Description</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Restore-UevUserSetting</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Restores the user settings for an application or restores a group of Windows settings</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n**To restore application settings and Windows settings with WMI**\n\n1.
