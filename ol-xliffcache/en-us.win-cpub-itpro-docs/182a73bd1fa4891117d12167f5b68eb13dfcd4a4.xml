The website enables end users to independently regain access to their computers if they get locked out of Windows. The Self-Service Portal requires no assistance from Help Desk staff.\n\nThe following instructions are written from the perspective of end users, but the information may be useful for IT administrators to understand.\n\n**Important**  \nAn end user must have physically logged on to the computer (not remotely) at least one time successfully to be able to recover their key using the Self-Service Portal. Otherwise, they must use the Helpdesk Portal for key recovery.\n\n \n\nEnd users may experience lockouts if they:\n\n-   Forget their password or PIN\n\n-   Change operating system files, the BIOS, or the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)\n\n**Note**  \nIf the IT administrator configured an IIS Session State time-out, a message is displayed in the Self-Service Portal 60 seconds prior to the time-out.\n\n \n\n**To use the Self-Service Portal to regain access to a computer**\n\n1.  In the **Recovery KeyId** field, enter a minimum of eight of the 32-digit BitLocker Key ID that is displayed on the BitLocker recovery screen of your computer. If the first eight digits match multiple keys, a message displays that requires you to enter all 32 digits of the recovery key ID.\n\n2.  In the **Reason** field, select a reason for your request for the recovery key.\n\n3.  Click **Get Key**. Your BitLocker recovery key is displayed in the **Your BitLocker Recovery Key** field.\n\n4.  Enter the 48-digit code into the BitLocker recovery screen on your computer to regain access to the computer.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for MBAM**?
