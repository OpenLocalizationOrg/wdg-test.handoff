Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) generates various reports to monitor BitLocker usage and compliance. This topic describes the MBAM reports for enterprise compliance, individual computers, hardware compatibility, and key recovery activity.\n\n## Understanding Reports\n\n\nTo access the Reports feature of MBAM, open the MBAM administration website. Select **Reports** in the navigation pane. Then, in the main content pane, click the tab for your report type: **Enterprise Compliance Report**, **Computer Compliance Report**, **Hardware Audit Report**, or **Recovery Audit Report**.\n\n### Enterprise Compliance Report\n\nAn Enterprise Compliance Report provides information on overall BitLocker compliance in your organization. The available filters for this report allow you to narrow your search results according to Compliance state and Error status.

To help you narrow your search results, this report includes filtering on criteria such as type of change and time of occurrence. Each state change is tracked by user and date and time. The Hardware Type is automatically populated by the MBAM agent that runs on the client computer. This report tracks user changes to the information collected directly from the MBAM managed computer. A typical administrative change is changing from Compatible to incompatible. However, the administrator can also revise any field.\n\n**Hardware Audit Report fields**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Column Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Date and Time</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Date and time that a change was made to the Hardware Type.

The filter criteria for this report includes type of user making the request, type of key requested, time of occurrence, success or fail, time of occurrence, and type of user requesting (help desk, end user). This report enables administrators to produce contextual reports based on need.\n\n**Recovery Audit Report Fields**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Column Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Request Date and Time</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The date and time that a key retrieval request was made by an end user or help desk user.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Request Status</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Status of the request.
