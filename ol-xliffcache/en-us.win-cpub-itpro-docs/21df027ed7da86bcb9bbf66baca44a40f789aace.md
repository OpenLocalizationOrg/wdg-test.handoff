# Manage inventory in Window Store for Business
When you acquire apps from the Windows Store for Business, we add them to the inventory for your organization. Once an app is part of your inventory, you can distribute the app, and manage licenses.

## Distribute apps
You can assign apps to people, or you can make apps available in your private store. Once an app is in your private store, people in your org can install the app on their devices. For more information, see [Distribute apps using your private store](distribute-apps-from-your-private-store.md).

**To make an app in inventory available in your private store**

1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.
3.  Click **Refine**, and then choose **Online**. Store for Business will update the list of apps on the **Inventory** page.
4.  From an app in **Inventory**, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **Add to private store**.

The value under Private store for the app will change to pending. It will take approximately twelve hours before the app is available in the private store. 

Employees can claim apps that admins added to the private store by doing the following.

**To claim an app from the private store**

1.  Sign in to your computer with your Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials, and start the Windows Store app.
2.  Click the private store tab.
3.  Click the app you want to install, and then click **Install**.

Another way to distribute apps is by assigning them to people in your organization. 

**To assign an app to an employee**

1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.
3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **Assign to people**.
4.  Type the email address for the employee that you're assigning the app to, and click **Confirm**.

Employees will receive an email with a link that will install the app on their device. Click the link to start the Windows Store app, and then click **Install**. Also, in the Windows Store app, they can find the app under **My Library**. 

## Manage licenses
For apps in inventory, when you assign an app to an employee, a license for the app is assigned to them. You can manage these licenses, either by assigning them, or reclaiming them so you can assign them to another employee. You can also remove an app from the private store. 

**To assign licenses**
1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.
3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **View license details**.
4.  Click **Assign to people**, type the name you are assigning the license to, and then click **Assign**. 

Store for Business assigns a license to the person, and adds them to the list of assigned licenses. 

**To reclaim licenses**
1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.
3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **View license details**.
4.  Click the name of the person you are reclaiming the license from, and then click **Reclaim licenses**. 

Store for Business reclaims the license, and updates the number of avialable licenses. After you reclaim a license, you can assign a license to another employee. 

**To remove an app from the private store**

If you decide that you don't want an app available for employees to install on their own, you can remove it from your private store. 
1.  Sign in to the [Store for Business](http://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2.  Click **Manage**, and then choose **Inventory**.
3.  Find an app, click the ellipses under **Action**, and then choose **Remove from private store**, and then click **Remove**.

The app will still be in your inventory, but your employees will not have access to the app from your private store.
