MBAM Server infrastructure\n\n\nUse the steps in the following sections to upgrade MBAM for the Stand-alone topology or the System Center Configuration Manager Integration topology.\n\n**To upgrade the MBAM Server infrastructure for Stand-alone topology**\n\n1.  Uninstall previous versions of MBAM from **Programs and Features** and from web servers to make sure that information is not being written from MBAM clients to the MBAM infrastructure. For instructions, see [Removing MBAM Server Features or Software](removing-mbam-server-features-or-software.md#bkmk-removeserverfeatures).\n\n2.  Back up your databases.\n\n3.  Uninstall previous versions of MBAM from SQL Server by using **Programs and Features**, including SQL Servers hosting the MBAM reports via SQL Server Reporting Services. Remove any remaining MBAM server temporary files or folders from the database server and reporting services.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The databases will not be removed, and all compliance and recovery data is maintained in the database.\n\n     \n\n4.  Install and configure the MBAM 2.5 or 2.5 SP1 databases, reports, and web applications, in that order. The databases are upgraded in place.\n\n5.  Update the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) using the MBAM 2.5 Templates to leverage the new features in MBAM, such as enforced encryption. If you do not update the GPOs and the MBAM client to MBAM 2.5, earlier versions of MBAM clients will continue to report against your current GPOs with reduced functionality. See [How to Get MDOP Group Policy (.admx) Templates](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41183) to download the latest ADMX templates.\n\n    After you upgrade the MBAM Server infrastructure, the existing client computers continue to successfully report to the MBAM 2.5 or 2.5 SP1 Server, and recovery data continues to be stored.\n\n6.  Install the latest MBAM 2.5 or 2.5 SP1 Client. Client computers do not need to be rebooted after the deployment.\n\n**To upgrade the MBAM infrastructure for System Center Configuration Manager Integration topology**\n\n1.  Uninstall previous versions of MBAM from **Programs and Features** and from web servers to make sure that information is not being written from MBAM clients to the MBAM infrastructure. For instructions, see [Removing MBAM Server Features or Software](removing-mbam-server-features-or-software.md#bkmk-removeserverfeatures).\n\n2.  Back up your databases.\n\n3.  Uninstall previous versions of MBAM from SQL Server by using **Programs and Features**, including SQL Servers hosting the MBAM reports via SQL Server Reporting Services. Remove any remaining MBAM server temporary files or folders from the database server and reporting services.\n\n4.  Uninstall MBAM from the Configuration Manager server.\n\n    **Note**  \n    The databases and the Configuration Manager objects (baseline, MBAM supported computers collection, and Reports) will not be removed, and all compliance and recovery data is maintained in the database.\n\n     \n\n5.  Update the .mof files.\n\n6.  Install and configure the MBAM 2.5 or 2.5 SP1 databases, reports, web applications, and Configuration Manager integration, in that order. The databases and Configuration Manager objects are upgraded in place.\n\n7.  Optionally, update the Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and edit the settings if you want to implement new features in MBAM, such as enforced encryption. If you do not update the GPOs, MBAM will continue to report against your current GPOs. See [How to Get MDOP Group Policy (.admx) Templates](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41183) to download the latest ADMX templates.\n\n    After you upgrade the MBAM Server infrastructure, the existing client computers continue to successfully report to the MBAM 2.5 or 2.5 SP1 Server, and recovery data continues to be stored.\n\n8.  Install the latest MBAM 2.5 or 2.5 SP1 Client. Client computers do not need to be rebooted after the deployment.\n\n## Upgrade support for the MBAM Client\n\n\nMBAM supports upgrades to the MBAM 2.5 Client from any earlier version of the MBAM Client.\n\n**Ways to install the MBAM Client:**\n\n-   Upgrade the computers running MBAM Client all at once or gradually after you install the MBAM 2.5 Server infrastructure.\n\n-   Install the MBAM Client through an electronic software distribution system or through tools such as Active Directory Domain Services or System Center Configuration Manager.\n\n## Got a suggestion for MBAM?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://mbam.uservoice.com/forums/268571-microsoft-bitlocker-administration-and-monitoring).
