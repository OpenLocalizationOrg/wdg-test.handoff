LOB publishers submit apps through the Windows Dev Center using the same process as all apps that are in the Store, and then can be managed or deployed using the same process as any other app that has been acquired through the Store.\n\nOne advantage of making apps available through Store for Business is that the app has been signed by the Store, and uses the standard Store policies.
