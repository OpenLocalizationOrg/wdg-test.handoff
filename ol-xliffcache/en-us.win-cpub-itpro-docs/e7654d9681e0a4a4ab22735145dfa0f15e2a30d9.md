# How to Lock or Unlock an Application


You can use the following procedures to lock or unlock any application in the Application Virtualization Desktop Client cache or the Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) cache. A locked application cannot be removed from the cache to make room for new applications. To remove a locked application from the Application Virtualization Desktop Client cache or the Client for Remote Desktop Services cache, you must first unlock it.

**To lock an application**

1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane.

2.  Right-click the desired application, and select **Lock** from the pop-up menu. The selected application is locked in the cache.

**To unlock an application**
