# What's new in AppLocker?

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

AppLocker helps you control which apps and files users can run. These include executable files, scripts, Windows Installer files, dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), packaged apps, and packaged app installers.
In Windows 10, AppLocker has added some improvements.

## New features in Windows 10

-   A new parameter was added to the [New-AppLockerPolicy](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847211.aspx) Windows PowerShell cmdlet that lets you choose whether executable and DLL rule collections apply to non-interactive processes. To enable this, set the **ServiceEnforcement** to **Enabled**.
-   A new [AppLocker](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn920019.aspx) configuration service provider was add to allow you to enable AppLocker rules by using an MDM server.
-   You can manage Windows 10 Mobile devices by using the new [AppLocker CSP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn920019.aspx).
