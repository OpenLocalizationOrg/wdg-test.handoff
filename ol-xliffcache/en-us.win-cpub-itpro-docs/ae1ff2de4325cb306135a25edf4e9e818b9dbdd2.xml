AES is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specification for the encryption of electronic data.\n\nThe encryption algorithm you choose must be specified for both the **ScanState** and the **LoadState** commands, so that these commands can create or read the store during encryption and decryption. The new encryption algorithms can be specified on the **ScanState** and the **LoadState** command lines by using the **/encrypt**:*\"encryptionstrength\"* and the **/decrypt**:*\"encryptionstrength\"* command-line options. All of the encryption application programming interfaces (APIs) used by USMT are available in Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 operating systems. However, export restrictions might limit the set of algorithms that are available to computers in certain locales. You can use the Usmtutils.exe file to determine which encryption algorithms are available to the computers' locales before you begin the migration.\n\nThe following table describes the command-line encryption options in USMT.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Component</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Option</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>ScanState</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>/encrypt</strong><em>&lt;AES, AES_128, AES_192, AES_256, 3DES, 3DES_112&gt;</em></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>This option and argument specify that the migration store is encrypted and which algorithm to use. When the algorithm argument is not provided, the <strong>ScanState</strong> tool employs the 3DES algorithm.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>LoadState</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>/decrypt</strong><em>&lt;AES, AES_128, AES_192, AES_256, 3DES, 3DES_112&gt;</em></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>This option and argument specify that the store must be decrypted and which algorithm to use. When the algorithm argument is not provided, the <strong>LoadState</strong> tool employs the 3DES algorithm.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n**Important**  \nSome encryption algorithms may not be available on your systems. You can verify which algorithms are available by running the UsmtUtils command with the **/ec** option.
