These rules are intended to help ensure that the files that are required for Windows to operate properly are allowed to run.\n\n>**Important:**  You can use the default rules as a template when creating your own rules to allow files within the Windows folders to run. However, these rules are only meant to function as a starter policy when you are first testing AppLocker rules. The default rules can be modified in the same way as other AppLocker rule types.\n \nYou can perform this task by using the Group Policy Management Console for an AppLocker policy in a Group Policy Object (GPO) or by using the Local Security Policy snap-in for an AppLocker policy on a local computer or in a security template. For information how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer AppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).\n\n**To create default rules**\n\n1.  Open the AppLocker console.\n2.  Right-click the appropriate rule type for which you want to automatically generate default rules. You can automatically generate rules for executable, Windows Installer, script rules and Packaged app rules.\n3.  Click **Create Default Rules**.\n"}
