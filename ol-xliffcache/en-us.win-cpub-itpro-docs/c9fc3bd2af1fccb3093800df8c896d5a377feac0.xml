But it's possible that you might have problems.\n\nIf you do, you can:\n\n-   Check that you meet the minimum operating system requirements and have the prerequisites installed.\n\n-   Check that there are no other updates or restarts waiting.\n\n-   Temporarily turn off your antispyware and antivirus software.\n\n-   Try another IE11 installer. For example from [Windows Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302315) or from the [Download Internet Explorer 11](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=327753) website.\n\n-   Review the `IE11_main.log` file in the `\\Windows` folder. This log file has information about each installation and is appended for each subsequent installation.\n\n-   Make sure you use the same download server URLs that you entered during the Setup process.\n\n## Internet Explorer didn't finish installing\nIf Internet Explorer doesn't finish installing, it might mean that Windows Update wasn't able to install an associated update, that you have a previous, unsupported version of IE installed, or that there's a problem with your copy of IE. We recommend you try this:\n\n ![](images/wedge.gif) **To fix this issue**\n\n1.  Uninstall IE:\n\n    1.  In the Control Panel, open the **Programs and Features** box, scroll down to IE11, and then click **Uninstall**.\n\n    2.  After the uninstall finishes, restart your computer.\n\n2.  Run [Windows Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302315), clicking **Check for updates**.\n\n3.  Check the list for IE11. If it's included in the list of updates for download, exclude it before you update your computer.<p>\nIf you get an error during the Windows Update process, see [Fix the problem with Microsoft Windows Update that is not working](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302316).\n\n4.  Restart your computer, making sure all of your the updates are finished.\n\n5.  Try to reinstall IE11 from either Windows Update (if you saw it in Step 3) or from the [Download Internet Explorer 11](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=327753) website.\n\nIf these steps didn't fix your problem, see [Troubleshooting a failed installation of Internet Explorer 11](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=304130).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
