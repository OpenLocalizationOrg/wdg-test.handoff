For example, you can copy a fix called MyFix from Database 1 to Database 2. However, if there is already a fix called MyFix in Database 2, Compatibility Administrator renames the fix as MyFix (1) to avoid duplicate names.\n\nIf you open the **Events** screen and then perform the copy operation, you can see a description of the action, along with the time stamp, which enables you to view your fix information without confusion.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Creating a Custom Compatibility Mode in Compatibility Administrator](creating-a-custom-compatibility-mode-in-compatibility-administrator.md)\n\n[Compatibility Administrator User's Guide](compatibility-administrator-users-guide.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
