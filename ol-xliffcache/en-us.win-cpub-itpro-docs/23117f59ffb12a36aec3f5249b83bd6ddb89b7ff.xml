To use PowerShell to create connection groups, see [How to Manage Connection Groups on a Stand-alone Computer by Using PowerShell](how-to-manage-connection-groups-on-a-stand-alone-computer-by-using-powershell51.md).\n\nWhen you place packages in a connection group, their package root paths are merged. If you remove packages, only the remaining packages maintain the merged root.\n\n**To create a connection group**\n\n1.  In the App-V 5.1 Management Console, select **CONNECTION GROUPS** to display the Connection Groups library.\n\n2.  Select **ADD CONNECTION GROUP** to create a new connection group.\n\n3.  In the **New Connection Group** pane, type a description for the group.\n\n4.  Click **EDIT** in the **CONNECTED PACKAGES** pane to add a new application to the connection group.\n\n5.  In the **PACKAGES Entire Library** pane, select the application to be added, and click the arrow to add the application.\n\n    To remove an application, select the application to be removed in the **PACKAGES IN** pane and click the arrow.\n\n    To reprioritize the applications in your connection group, use the arrows in the **PACKAGES IN** pane.\n\n    **Important**  \n    By default, the Active Directory Domain Services access configurations that are associated with a specific application are not added to the connection group. To transfer the Active Directory access configuration, select **ADD PACKAGE ACCESS TO GROUP ACCESS**, which is located in the **PACKAGES IN** pane.\n\n     \n\n6.  After adding all the applications and configuring Active Directory access, click **Apply**.\n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
