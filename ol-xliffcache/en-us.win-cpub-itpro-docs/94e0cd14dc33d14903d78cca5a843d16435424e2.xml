If VAMT is being used to manage products and product keys on the local host computer and you do not have administrator privileges, start VAMT with elevated privileges. For Active Directory-Based Activation use, for best results we recommend running VAMT while logged on as a domain administrator. \n\n**Note**  \nThe VAMT Microsoft Management Console snap-in ships as an x86 package. \n\nAfter you install VAMT, if you have a computer information list (CIL) that was created in a previous version of VAMT, you must import the list into a SQL database. If you do not have SQL installed, you can download a free copy of Microsoft SQL Server Express and create a new database into which you can import the CIL. To install SQL Server Express:\n1.  Install the Windows ADK.\n2.  Ensure that **Volume Activation Management Tool** and **Microsoft® SQL Server® 2012 Express** are selected to be installed.\n3.  Click **Install**.\n\n## Select a Database\n\n**Using a SQL database installed during ADK setup**\nIf SQL Server 2012 Express was installed during ADK setup, the default database name will be **ADK**.By default, VAMT is configure to use a SQL database that is installed on the local machine during ADK setup and displays the server name as **.\\\\ADK**. If the SQL database was installed on another machine, you must configure the database to allow remote connections and you must provide the corresponding server name. If a new VAMT database needs to be created, provide a name for the new database.\n\n**Using a SQL database installed outside of ADK setup**\n\nYou must configure SQL installation to allow remote connections and you must provide the corresponding server name in the format: *Machine Name\\\\SQL Server Name*. If a new VAMT database needs to be created, provide a name for the new database.\n\n## Uninstall VAMT\n\nTo uninstall VAMT via the **Programs and Features** Control Panel:\n1.  Open the **Control Panel** and select **Programs and Features**.\n2.  Select **Assessment and Deployment Kit** from the list of installed programs and click **Change**. Follow the instructions in the Windows ADK installer to remove VAMT.\n\n## Related topics\n- [Install and Configure VAMT](install-configure-vamt.md)\n \n \n"}
