The handle to an object was closed” in [Audit File System](audit-file-system.md), [Audit Kernel Object](audit-kernel-object.md), [Audit Registry](audit-registry.md), [Audit Removable Storage](audit-removable-storage.md) and [Audit SAM](audit-sam.md) subcategories, and shows object’s handle duplication and close actions.\n\n**Event volume**: High.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments

to an object.\n\n## 4658(S): The handle to an object was closed.\n\nThis event doesn’t generate in this subcategory, but you can use this subcategory to enable it.
