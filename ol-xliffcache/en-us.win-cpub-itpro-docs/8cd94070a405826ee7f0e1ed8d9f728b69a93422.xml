For the purposes of this topic, the application we are adding is Adobe Reader XI. In addition to using computer-specific entries in the database, you can use roles in MDT to group settings together.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"sec01\"></a>Create and assign a role entry in the database\n\n1.  On MDT01, using Deployment Workbench, in the MDT Production deployment share, expand **Advanced Configuration** and then expand **Database**.\n2.  In the **Database** node, right-click **Role**, select **New**, and create a role entry with the following settings:\n    1.  Role name: Standard PC\n    2.  Applications / Lite Touch Applications:\n    3.  Install - Adobe Reader XI - x86\n\n![figure 12](images/mdt-09-fig12.png)\n\nFigure 12. The Standard PC role with the application added\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"sec02\"></a>Associate the role with a computer in the database\n\nAfter creating the role, you can associate it with one or more computer entries.\n1.  Using Deployment Workbench, expand **MDT Production**, expand **Advanced Configuration**, expand **Database**, and select **Computers**.\n2.  In the **Computers** node, double-click the **PC00075** entry, and add the following setting:\n    -   Roles: Standard PC\n\n![figure 13](images/mdt-09-fig13.png)\n\nFigure 13. The Standard PC role added to PC00075 (having ID 1 in the database).\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"sec03\"></a>Verify database access in the MDT simulation environment\n\nWhen the database is populated, you can use the MDT simulation environment to simulate a deployment. The applications are not installed, but you can see which applications would be installed if you did a full deployment of the computer.\n1.  On PC0001, log on as **CONTOSO\\\\MDT\\_BA**.\n2.  Modify the C:\\\\MDT\\\\CustomSettings.ini file to look like the following:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    [Settings]\n    Priority=CSettings, CRoles, RApplications, Default\n    [Default]\n    _SMSTSORGNAME=Contoso\n    OSInstall=Y\n    UserDataLocation=AUTO\n    TimeZoneName=Pacific Standard Time \n    AdminPassword=P@ssw0rd\n    JoinDomain=contoso.com\n    DomainAdmin=CONTOSO\\MDT_JD\n    DomainAdminPassword=P@ssw0rd\n    MachineObjectOU=OU=Workstations,OU=Computers,OU=Contoso,DC=contoso,DC=com\n    SLShare=\\\\MDT01\\Logs$\n    ScanStateArgs=/ue:*\\* /ui:CONTOSO\\*\n    USMTMigFiles001=MigApp.xml\n    USMTMigFiles002=MigUser.xml\n    HideShell=YES\n    ApplyGPOPack=NO\n    SkipAppsOnUpgrade=NO\n    SkipAdminPassword=YES\n    SkipProductKey=YES\n    SkipComputerName=NO\n    SkipDomainMembership=YES\n    SkipUserData=NO\n    SkipLocaleSelection=YES\n    SkipTaskSequence=NO\n    SkipTimeZone=YES\n    SkipApplications=NO\n    SkipBitLocker=YES\n    SkipSummary=YES\n    SkipCapture=YES\n    SkipFinalSummary=NO\n    EventService=http://MDT01:9800\n    [CSettings]\n    SQLServer=MDT01\n    Instance=SQLEXPRESS\n    Database=MDT\n    Netlib=DBNMPNTW\n    SQLShare=Logs$\n    Table=ComputerSettings\n    Parameters=UUID, AssetTag, SerialNumber, MacAddress\n    ParameterCondition=OR\n    [CRoles]\n    SQLServer=MDT01\n    Instance=SQLEXPRESS\n    Database=MDT\n    Netlib=DBNMPNTW\n    SQLShare=Logs$\n    Table=ComputerRoles\n    Parameters=UUID, AssetTag, SerialNumber, MacAddress\n    ParameterCondition=OR\n    [RApplications]\n    SQLServer=MDT01\n    Instance=SQLEXPRESS\n    Database=MDT\n    Netlib=DBNMPNTW\n    SQLShare=Logs$\n    Table=RoleApplications\n    Parameters=Role\n    Order=Sequence\n    ```\n\n3.  Using an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt (run as Administrator), run the following commands. Press **Enter** after each command:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Set-Location C:\\MDT\n    .\\Gather.ps1\n\n    ```\n\n![figure 14](images/mdt-09-fig14.png)\n\nFigure 14.
