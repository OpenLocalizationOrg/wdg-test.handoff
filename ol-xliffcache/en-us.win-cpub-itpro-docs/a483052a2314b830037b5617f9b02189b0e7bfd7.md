# Sign up for Windows Store for Business


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

Before you sign up for Windows Store for Business, at a minimum, you'll need an Azure Active Directory (AD) account for your organization, and you'll need to be the global administrator for your organization. If your organization is already using Azure AD, you can go ahead and sign up for Store for Business. If not, we'll help you create an Azure AD account and directory as part of the sign up process.

## Sign up for Store for Business


Before signing up for the Store for Business, make sure you're the global administrator for your organization.

**To sign up for the Store for Business**

1.  Go to [https://www.microsoft.com/business-store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=691845), and click **Sign up**.

    -   If you start the Store for Business sign up process, and don't have an Azure AD directory for your organization, we'll help you create one. For more info, see [Sign up for Azure AD accounts](#o365-welcome).
