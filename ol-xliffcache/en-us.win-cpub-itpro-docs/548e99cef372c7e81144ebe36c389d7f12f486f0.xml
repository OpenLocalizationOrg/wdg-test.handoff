For files that are not digitally signed, file hash rules are more secure than path rules. The following table describes the advantages and disadvantages of the file hash condition.\n\n| File hash condition advantages | File hash condition disadvantages |\n| - | - |\n| Because each file has a unique hash, a file hash condition applies to only one file. | Each time that the file is updated (such as a security update or upgrade), the file's hash will change. As a result, you must manually update file hash rules.|\n \nFor an overview of the three types of AppLocker rule conditions and explanations of the advantages and disadvantages of each, see [Understanding AppLocker rule condition types](understanding-applocker-rule-condition-types.md).\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [How AppLocker works](how-applocker-works-techref.md)\n"}
