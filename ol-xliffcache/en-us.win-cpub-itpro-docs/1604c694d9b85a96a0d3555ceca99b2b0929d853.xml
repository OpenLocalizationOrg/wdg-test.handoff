The topics in this section describe all the configurable settings in the MED-V workspace policy as well as how these settings influence the MED-V workspace.\n\nThe following MED-V workspace types are available:\n\n-   **Persistent**—In a persistent MED-V workspace, all changes and additions the user makes to the MED-V workspace are saved in the MED-V workspace between sessions. Additionally, a persistent MED-V workspace is generally used in a domain environment.\n\n-   **Revertible**—In a revertible MED-V workspace, at the completion of each session (that is, when the MED-V workspace is stopped), the MED-V workspace reverts to its original state during deployment. No changes or additions that the user made are saved on the MED-V workspace between sessions. A revertible MED-V workspace cannot be used in a domain environment.\n\nIt is important to decide on the type of MED-V workspace you are creating before deploying the MED-V workspace, because it is not recommended to reconfigure the type of MED-V workspace after a policy has been deployed to users.\n\n**Note**  \nWhen configuring a policy, a warning symbol appears next to mandatory fields that are not filled in. If a mandatory field is not filled in, the symbol appears on the tab as well.\n\n \n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-apply-general-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[How to Apply General Settings to a MED-V Workspace](how-to-apply-general-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes the general settings of a MED-V workspace, and how to apply them to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-apply-virtual-machine-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[How to Apply Virtual Machine Settings to a MED-V Workspace](how-to-apply-virtual-machine-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes the virtual machine settings for a MED-V workspace, and how to apply them to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-a-domain-user-or-group\"></a>[How to Configure a Domain User or Group](how-to-configure-a-domain-user-or-groupmedvv2.md)  \nDescribes how to configure domain users and groups.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-published-applications\"></a>[How to Configure Published Applications](how-to-configure-published-applicationsmedvv2.md)  \nDescribes published applications and menus, and how to apply them to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-web-settings-for-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[How to Configure Web Settings for a MED-V Workspace](how-to-configure-web-settings-for-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes the Web settings available for a MED-V workspace, and how to apply them to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-the-virtual-machine-setup-for-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[How to Configure the Virtual Machine Setup for a MED-V Workspace](how-to-configure-the-virtual-machine-setup-for-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes the virtual machine setup for a MED-V workspace, and how to apply it to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-apply-network-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[How to Apply Network Settings to a MED-V Workspace](how-to-apply-network-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes the network settings of a MED-V workspace, and how to apply them to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-apply-performance-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace\"></a>[How to Apply Performance Settings to a MED-V Workspace](how-to-apply-performance-settings-to-a-med-v-workspace.md)  \nDescribes the performance settings of a MED-V workspace, and how to apply them to a policy.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-import-and-export-a-policy\"></a>[How to Import and Export a Policy](how-to-import-and-export-a-policy.md)  \nDescribes how to import and export a policy.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
