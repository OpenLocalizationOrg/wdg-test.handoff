# Windows spotlight on the lock screen


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

Windows spotlight is an option for the lock screen background that displays different background images and occasionally offers suggestions on the lock screen. Windows spotlight is now available in Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, and Windows 10 Education. For managed devices running Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education, enterprise administrators can configure a mobile device management (MDM) or Group Policy setting to prevent users from using the Windows spotlight background.

## What does Windows spotlight include?


-   **Background image**

    The Windows spotlight displays a new image on the lock screen each day. The initial background image is included during installation. Additional images are downloaded on ongoing basis.

Pay attention to the checkbox in **Options**. In addition to providing the path to the lock screen image, administrators can choose to allow or **Turn off fun facts, tips, tricks, and more on lock screen**. If the checkbox is not selected, users will see the lock screen image that is defined in the policy setting, and will also see occasional messages, such as the example in the following image.
