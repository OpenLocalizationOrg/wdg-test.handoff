following procedure to install the App-V 5.0 server. For information about deploying the App-V 5.0 SP3 Server, see [About App-V 5.0 SP3](about-app-v-50-sp3.md#bkmk-migrate-to-50sp3).\n\n**Before you start:**\n\n-   Ensure that you’ve installed prerequisite software. See [App-V 5.0 Prerequisites](app-v-50-prerequisites.md).\n\n-   Review the server section of [App-V 5.0 Security Considerations](app-v-50-security-considerations.md).\n\n-   Specify a port where each component will be hosted.\n\n-   Add firewall rules to allow incoming requests to access the specified ports.\n\n-   If you use SQL scripts, instead of the Windows Installer, to set up the Management database or Reporting database, you must run the SQL scripts before installing the Management Server or Reporting Server. See [How to Deploy the App-V Databases by Using SQL Scripts](how-to-deploy-the-app-v-databases-by-using-sql-scripts.md).\n\n**To install the App-V 5.0 server**\n\n1.  Copy the App-V 5.0 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it.\n\n2.  Start the App-V 5.0 server installation by right-clicking and running **appv\\_server\\_setup.exe** as an administrator, and then click **Install**.\n\n3.  Review and accept the license terms, and choose whether to enable Microsoft updates.\n\n4.
