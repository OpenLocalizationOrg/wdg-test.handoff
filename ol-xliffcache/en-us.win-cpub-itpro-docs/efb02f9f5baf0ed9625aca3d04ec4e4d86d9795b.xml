Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](security-identifiers.md).\n\n-   **Account Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** the name of the account that requested the “move object” operation.\n\n-   **Account Domain** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** subject’s domain or computer name. Formats vary, and include the following:\n\n    -   Domain NETBIOS name example: CONTOSO\n\n    -   Lowercase full domain name: contoso.local\n\n    -   Uppercase full domain name: CONTOSO.LOCAL\n\n    -   For some [well-known security principals](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/243330), such as LOCAL SERVICE or ANONYMOUS LOGON, the value of this field is “NT AUTHORITY”.\n\n    -   For local user accounts, this field will contain the name of the computer or device that this account belongs to, for example: “Win81”.\n\n-   **Logon ID** \\[Type = HexInt64\\]**:** hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, “[4624](event-4624.md): An account was successfully logged on.”\n\n**Directory Service:**\n\n-   **Name** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: the name of an Active Directory domain, where the object was moved.\n\n-   **Type** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]**:** has “**Active Directory Domain Services**” value for this event.\n\n**Object:**\n\n-   **Old DN** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: Old distinguished name of moved object.\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;The LDAP API references an LDAP object by its **distinguished name (DN)**.

The Active Directory container to which the object was moved.\n\n-   **GUID** \\[Type = GUID\\]**:** each Active Directory object has globally unique identifier (GUID), which is a 128-bit value that is unique not only in the enterprise but also across the world. GUIDs are assigned to every object created by Active Directory. Each object's GUID is stored in its Object-GUID (**objectGUID**) property.\n\n    Active Directory uses GUIDs internally to identify objects. For example, the GUID is one of an object's properties that is published in the global catalog. Searching the global catalog for a User object's GUID will yield results if the user has an account somewhere in the enterprise. In fact, searching for any object by Object-GUID might be the most reliable way of finding the object you want to find. The values of other object properties can change, but the Object-GUID never changes. When an object is assigned a GUID, it keeps that value for life.\n\n    Event Viewer automatically resolves **GUID** field to real object.\n\n    To translate this GUID, use the following procedure:\n\n    -   Perform the following LDAP search using LDP.exe tool:\n\n        -   Base DN: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=XXX,DC=XXX\n\n        -   Filter: (&(objectClass=\\*)(objectGUID=GUID))\n\n            -   Perform the following operations with the GUID before using it in a search request:\n\n                -   We have this GUID to search for: a6b34ab5-551b-4626-b8ee-2b36b3ee6672\n\n                -   Take first 3 sections a6b34ab5-551b-4626.\n\n                -   For each of these 3 sections you need to change (Invert) the order of bytes, like this b54ab3a6-1b55-2646\n\n                -   Add the last 2 sections without transformation: b54ab3a6-1b55-2646-b8ee-2b36b3ee6672\n\n                -   Delete - : b54ab3a61b552646b8ee2b36b3ee6672\n\n                -   Divide bytes with backslashes: \\\\b5\\\\4a\\\\b3\\\\a6\\\\1b\\\\55\\\\26\\\\46\\\\b8\\\\ee\\\\2b\\\\36\\\\b3\\\\ee\\\\66\\\\72\n\n            -   Filter example: (&(objectClass=\\*)(objectGUID = \\\\b5\\\\4a\\\\b3\\\\a6\\\\1b\\\\55\\\\26\\\\46\\\\b8\\\\ee\\\\2b\\\\36\\\\b3\\\\ee\\\\66\\\\72))\n\n        -   Scope: Subtree\n\n        -   Attributes: objectGUID\n\n-   **Class** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: class of the object that was moved. Some of the common Active Directory object classes:\n\n    -   container – for containers.\n\n    -   user – for users.\n\n    -   group – for groups.\n\n    -   domainDNS – for domain object.\n\n    -   groupPolicyContainer – for group policy objects.\n\n        For all possible values of this field open Active Directory Schema snap-in (see how to enable this snap-in: <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Cc755885(v=WS.10).aspx)> and navigate to **Active Directory Schema\\\\Classes**. Or use this document: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc221630.aspx>\n\n**Operation:**\n\n-   **Correlation ID** \\[Type = GUID\\]: multiple modifications are often executed as one operation via LDAP. This value allows you to correlate all the modification events that comprise the operation. Just look for other events from current subcategory with the same **Correlation ID**, for example “[5137](event-5137.md): A directory service object was created.” and “[5141](event-5141.md): A directory service object was deleted.”\n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;**GUID** is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier'. It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources, activities or instances.\n\n-   **Application Correlation ID** \\[Type = UnicodeString\\]: always has “**-**“ value. Not in use.\n\n## Security Monitoring Recommendations\n\nFor 5139(S): A directory service object was moved.\n\n> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;For this event, also see [Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events](appendix-a-security-monitoring-recommendations-for-many-audit-events.md).\n\n-   If you need to monitor movement of Active Directory objects with specific classes, monitor for **Class** field with specific class name.\n\n-   You must set correct auditing access lists (SACLs) for specific classes within Active Directory container to get [5139](event-5139.md). There is no reason to audit all movement events for all types of Active Directory objects, you need to find the most important locations (organizational units, folders, etc.) and monitor for movement of specific classes only to these locations (user, computer, group, etc.).\n\n"}
