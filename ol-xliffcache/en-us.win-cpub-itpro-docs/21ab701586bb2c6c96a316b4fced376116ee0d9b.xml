State Migration Tool (USMT) 10.0 when hardware and/or operating system upgrades are planned for a large number of computers. USMT manages the migration of an end-user's digital identity by capturing the user's operating-system settings, application settings, and personal files from a source computer and reinstalling them on a destination computer after the upgrade has occurred.\n\nOne common scenario when only the operating system, and not the hardware, is being upgraded is referred to as *PC refresh*. A second common scenario is known as *PC replacement*, where one piece of hardware is being replaced, typically by newer hardware and a newer operating system.\n\n## In This Topic\n\n\n[PC Refresh](#bkmk-pcrefresh)\n\n[Scenario One: PC-refresh offline using Windows PE and a hard-link migration store](#bkmk-onepcrefresh)\n\n[Scenario Two: PC-refresh using a compressed migration store](#bkmk-twopcrefresh)\n\n[Scenario Three: PC-refresh using a hard-link migration store](#bkmk-threepcrefresh)\n\n[Scenario Four: PC-refresh using Windows.old folder and a hard-link migration store](#bkmk-fourpcrefresh)\n\n[PC Replacement](#bkmk-pcreplace)\n\n[Scenario One: Offline migration using Windows PE and an external migration store](#bkmk-onepcreplace)\n\n[Scenario Two: Manual network migration](#bkmk-twopcreplace)\n\n[Scenario Three: Managed network migration](#bkmk-threepcreplace)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-pcrefresh\"></a>PC-Refresh\n\n\nThe following diagram shows a PC-refresh migration, also known as a computer refresh migration. First, the administrator migrates the user state from a source computer to an intermediate store. After installing the operating system, the administrator migrates the user state back to the source computer.\n\n \n\n![usmt pc refresh scenario](images/dep-win8-l-usmt-pcrefresh.jpg)\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-onepcrefresh\"></a>Scenario One: PC-refresh offline using Windows PE and a hard-link migration store\n\nA company has just received funds to update the operating system on all of its computers in the accounting department to Windows 10. Each employee will keep the same computer, but the operating system on each computer will be updated. In this scenario, the update is being handled completely offline, without a network connection. An administrator uses Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) and a hard-link migration store to save each user state to their respective computer.\n\n1.  On each computer, the administrator boots the machine into WinPE and runs the ScanState command-line tool, specifying the **/hardlink /nocompress** command-line options. ScanState saves the user state to a hard-link migration store on each computer, improving performance by minimizing network traffic as well as minimizing migration failures on computers with very limited space available on the hard drive.\n\n2.  On each computer, the administrator installs the company’s standard operating environment (SOE) which includes Windows 10 and other company applications.\n\n3.  The administrator runs the LoadState command-line tool on each computer. LoadState restores each user state back to each computer.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-twopcrefresh\"></a>Scenario Two: PC-refresh using a compressed migration store\n\nA company has just received funds to update the operating system on all of its computers to Windows 10. Each employee will keep the same computer, but the operating system on each computer will be updated. In this scenario, an administrator uses a compressed migration store to save the user states to a server.\n\n1.  The administrator runs the ScanState command-line tool on each computer. ScanState saves each user state to a server.\n\n2.  On each computer, the administrator installs the company's standard SOE which includes Windows 10 and other company applications.\n\n3.  The administrator runs the LoadState command-line tool on each source computer, and LoadState restores each user state back to the computer.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-threepcrefresh\"></a>Scenario Three: PC-refresh using a hard-link migration store\n\nA company has just received funds to update the operating system on all of its computers to Windows 10. Each employee will keep the same computer, but the operating system on each computer will be updated. In this scenario, an administrator uses a hard-link migration store to save each user state to their respective computer.\n\n1.

Each employee will keep the same computer, but the operating system on each computer will be updated. In this scenario, an administrator uses Windows.old and a hard-link migration store to save each user state to their respective computer.\n\n1.  The administrator clean installs Windows 10 on each computer, making sure that the Windows.old directory is created by installing Windows 10 without formatting or repartitioning and by selecting a partition that contains the previous version of Windows.\n\n2.  On each computer, the administrator installs the company’s SOE which includes company applications.\n\n3.  The administrator runs the ScanState and LoadState command-line tools successively on each computer while specifying the **/hardlink /nocompress** command-line options.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-pcreplace\"></a>PC-Replacement\n\n\nThe following diagram shows a PC-replacement migration. First, the administrator migrates the user state from the source computer to an intermediate store. After installing the operating system on the destination computer, the administrator migrates the user state from the store to the destination computer.\n\n \n\n![usmt pc replace scenario](images/dep-win8-l-usmt-pcreplace.jpg)\n\n \n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-onepcreplace\"></a>Scenario One: Offline migration using WinPE and an external migration store\n\nA company is allocating 20 new computers to users in the accounting department.

The administrator runs the ScanState tool on each of the manager’s old laptops, and saves each user state to a server.\n\n2.  On the new laptops, the administrator installs the company's SOE, which includes Windows 10 and other company applications.\n\n3.  The administrator runs the LoadState tool on the new laptops to migrate the managers’ user states to the appropriate computer. The new laptops are now ready for the managers to use.\n\n4.
