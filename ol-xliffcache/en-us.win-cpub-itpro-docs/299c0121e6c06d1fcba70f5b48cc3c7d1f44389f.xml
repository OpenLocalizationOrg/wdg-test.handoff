For more information about exceptions, see [Understanding AppLocker rule exceptions](understanding-applocker-rule-exceptions.md).\n\nYou can perform this task by using the Group Policy Management Console for an AppLocker policy in a Group Policy Object (GPO) or by using the Local Security Policy snap-in for an AppLocker policy on a local computer or in a security template. For info how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer AppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).\n\n**To configure exceptions for a rule**\n\n1.  Open the AppLocker console.\n2.  Expand the rule collection, right-click the rule that you want to configure exceptions for, and then click **Properties**.\n3.  Click the **Exceptions** tab.\n4.  In the **Add exception** box, select the rule type that you want to create, and then click **Add**.\n\n    -   For a publisher exception, click **Browse**, select the file that contains the publisher to exclude, and then click **OK**.\n    -   For a path exception, choose the file or folder path to exclude, and then click **OK**.\n    -   For a file hash exception, edit the file hash rule, and click **Remove**.\n    -   For a packaged apps exception, click **Add** to create the exceptions based on reference app and rule scope.\n \n \n"}
