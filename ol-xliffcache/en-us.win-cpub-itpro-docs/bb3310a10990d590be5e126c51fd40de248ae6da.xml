Right-click the Application Virtualization System icon in the notification area.\n\n2.  Select **Refresh Applications** from the pop-up-menu. The new shortcuts appear where designated by the system administrator—for example, on your desktop, **Start** menu, or **Quick Launch** menu, depending on the configuration of the Application Virtualization Server and your desktop.\n\n    **Note**  \n    Following are additional ways you can refresh the publishing information from the servers:\n\n    -   Right-click the server in the **Results** pane, and select **Refresh Server** from the pop-up menu.\n\n    -   Right-click the server in the **Results** pane, and then select **Properties** from the pop-up menu.
