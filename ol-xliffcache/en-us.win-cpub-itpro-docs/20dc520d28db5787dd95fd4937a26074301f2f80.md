# About the Files Tab


The **Files** tab displays the complete list of files that are included in a sequenced application package. The left pane displays, in a standard file browse format, the complete list of files in the package that was created during the application sequencing. These files include the package root directory (the directory you specified during the application installation phase), the Virtual File System (VFS) folder, and the virtual environment files. The right pane displays the file name, file attributes, and the Sequencer attributes.

## File Name and Short Name

The name of the file is in the left pane. The files displayed in the left pane are created during sequencing.

<a href="" id="short-name"></a>**Short Name**  
This is the name of a file selected in the left pane, written in the 8.3 format naming convention.
