The file configures the default settings for package for all users on the computer running the App-V 5.1 client. This section describes the steps used to use a deployment configuration file. The procedure is based on the following example and assumes the following package and configuration files exist on a computer:\n\n**c:\\\\Packages\\\\Contoso\\\\MyApp.appv**\n\n**c:\\\\Packages\\\\Contoso\\\\DynamicConfigurations\\\\deploymentconfig.xml**\n\n**To Apply the Deployment Configuration File Using PowerShell**\n\n-   To specify a new default set of configurations for all users who will run the package on a specific computer, using a PowerShell console type the following:\n\n    **Add-AppVClientPackage –Path c:\\\\Packages\\\\Contoso\\\\MyApp.appv -DynamicDeploymentConfiguration c:\\\\Packages\\\\Contoso\\\\DynamicConfigurations\\\\deploymentconfig.xml**\n\n    **Note**  \n    This command captures the resulting object into $pkg. If the package is already present on the computer, the **Set-AppVclientPackage** cmdlet can be used to apply the deployment configuration document:\n\n    **Set-AppVClientPackage –Name Myapp –Path c:\\\\Packages\\\\Contoso\\\\MyApp.appv -DynamicDeploymentConfiguration c:\\\\Packages\\\\Contoso\\\\DynamicConfigurations\\\\deploymentconfig.xml**\n\n     \n\n    **Got a suggestion for App-V**?
