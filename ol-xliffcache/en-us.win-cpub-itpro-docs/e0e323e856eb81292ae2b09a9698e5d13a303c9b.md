# Remove sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

Remove websites that were added to a local Enterprise Mode site list by mistake or because the sites no longer have compatibility problems.

**Note**<br>The changes described in this topic only impact sites added to a local Enterprise Mode site list and not the list of sites deployed to all employees by an administrator. Employees can't delete sites added to the list by an administrator.

1.  Open Internet Explorer 11 and go to the site you want to remove.

2.  Click **Tools**, and then click **Enterprise Mode**.<p>
The checkmark disappears from next to Enterprise Mode and the site is removed from the list.

**Note**<br>If the site is removed by mistake, it can be added back by clicking **Enterprise Mode** again.

1.  Open IE11, click **Tools**, and then click **Internet options**.

2.  Click the **Delete** button from the **Browsing history** area.

3.  Click the box next to **Cookies and website data**, and then click **Delete**.

**Note**<br>This removes all of the sites from a local Enterprise Mode site list.
