Additionally, an Editor can request that a GPO be created, deleted, or restored. An Approver must approve the request for it to be implemented. An Editor can export a GPO to a file so that it can be copied to a domain in another forest, and import a GPO that was copied from another domain.\n\n**Important**  \nMake sure that you are connecting to the central archive for GPOs.
