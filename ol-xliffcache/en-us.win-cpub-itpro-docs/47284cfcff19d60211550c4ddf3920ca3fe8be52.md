# Deploying MBAM 2.0


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) supports a number of different deployment configurations. This section includes information that you should consider about the deployment of MBAM and step-by-step procedures to help you successfully perform the tasks that you must complete at different stages of your deployment.

You can deploy MBAM either in a Stand-alone topology, or with a topology that integrates MBAM with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 or Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager. For information about installing MBAM with the Configuration Manager integrated topology, see [Using MBAM with Configuration Manager](using-mbam-with-configuration-manager.md).
