Setting its value to **Enabled** prevents the domain member from changing the machine account password. Setting it to **Disabled** allows the domain member to change the machine account password as specified by the value of the [Domain member: Maximum machine account password age](domain-member-maximum-machine-account-password-age.md) policy setting, which is every 30 days by default.\n\nBy default, devices that belong to a domain are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts every 30 days. Devices that are no longer able to automatically change their machine password are at risk of a malicious user determining the password for the system's domain account.\nVerify that the **Domain member: Disable machine account password changes** option is set to **Disabled**.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n-   Disabled\n\n### Best practices\n\n1.  Do not enable this policy setting. Machine account passwords are used to establish secure channel communications between members and domain controllers and between the domain controllers within the domain. After it is established, the secure channel transmits sensitive information that is necessary for making authentication and authorization decisions.\n2.  Do not use this policy setting in an attempt to support dual-boot scenarios that use the same machine account. If you want to dual-boot installations that are joined to the same domain, give the two installations different computer names. This policy setting was added to the Windows operating system to make it easier for organizations that stockpile pre-built computers that are put into production months later; those devices do not have to be rejoined to the domain.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value | \n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy | Disabled | \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Disabled| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Disabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Disabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nBy default, devices running Windows Server that belong to a domain automatically change their passwords for their accounts every certain number of days, typically 30. If you disable this policy setting, devices that run Windows Server retain the same passwords as their machine accounts. Devices \nthat cannot automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the machine's domain account.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nVerify that the **Domain member: Disable machine account password changes** setting is configured to **Disabled**.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nNone. This is the default configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
