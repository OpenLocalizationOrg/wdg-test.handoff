You can use a System Center Configuration Manager task sequence to completely automate the process.\n\n## Proof-of-concept environment\n\n\nFor the purposes of this topic, we will use four machines: DC01, CM01, and PC0003. DC01 is a domain controller and CM01 is a Windows Server 2012 R2 standard machine, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as a member server in the fictional contoso.com domain. PC0003 is a machine with Windows 7 SP1, targeted for the Windows 10 upgrade. For more details on the setup for this topic, please see [Deploy Windows 10 with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](deploy-windows-10-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit.md).\n\n![figure 1](images/upgrademdt-fig1-machines.png)\n\nFigure 1. The machines used in this topic.\n\n## Upgrade to Windows 10 with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager\n\n\nSystem Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager SP1 adds support to manage and deploy Windows 10. Although it does not include built-in support to perform an in-place upgrade from Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, you can build a custom task sequence to perform the necessary tasks.\n\n## Create the task sequence\n\n\nTo help with this process, the Configuration Manager team has published [a blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620179) that provides a sample task sequence, as well as the [original blog that includes the instructions for setting up the task sequence](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620180). To summarize, here are the tasks you need to perform:\n\n1.  Download the [Windows10Upgrade1506.zip](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620182) file that contains the sample task sequence and related scripts. Extract the contents onto a network share.\n2.  Copy the Windows 10 Enterprise RTM x64 media into the extracted but empty **Windows vNext Upgrade Media** folder.\n3.  Using the Configuration Manager Console, right-click the **Task Sequences** node, and then choose **Import Task Sequence**. Select the **Windows-vNextUpgradeExport.zip** file that you extracted in Step 1.\n4.  Distribute the two created packages (one contains the Windows 10 Enterprise x64 media, the other contains the related scripts) to the Configuration Manager distribution point.\n\nFor full details and an explanation of the task sequence steps, review the full details of the two blogs that are referenced above.\n\n## Create a device collection\n\n\nAfter you create the upgrade task sequence, you can create a collection to test a deployment. In this section, we assume you have the PC0003 machine running Windows 7 SP1, with the Configuration Manager client installed.\n\n1.  On CM01, using the Configuration Manager console, in the Asset and Compliance workspace, right-click **Device Collections**, and then select **Create Device Collection**. Use the following settings:\n    -   General\n\n        -   Name: Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Upgrade\n\n        -   Limited Collection: All Systems\n\n    -   Membership rules:\n\n        -   Direct rule\n\n            -   Resource Class: System Resource\n\n            -   Attribute Name: Name\n\n            -   Value: PC0003\n\n        -   Select Resources\n\n        -   Select PC0003\n\n2.  Review the Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Upgrade collection. Do not continue until you see the PC0003 machine in the collection.\n\n## Deploy the Windows 10 upgrade\n\n\nIn this section, you create a deployment for the Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Update application.\n\n1.  On CM01, using the Configuration Manager console, in the Software Library workspace, right-click the **Windows vNext Upgrade** task sequence, and then select **Deploy**.\n2.  On the **General** page, select the **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Upgrade** collection, and then click **Next**.\n3.  On the **Content** page, click **Next**.\n4.  On the **Deployment Settings** page, select the following settings, and then click **Next**:\n    -   Action: Install\n\n    -   Purpose: Available\n\n5.  On the **Scheduling** page, accept the default settings, and then click **Next**.\n6.  On the **User Experience** page, accept the default settings, and then click **Next**.\n7.  On the **Alerts** page, accept the default settings, and then click **Next**.\n8.  On the **Summary** page, click **Next**, and then click **Close**.\n\n## Start the Windows 10 upgrade\n\n\nIn this section, you start the Windows 10 Upgrade task sequence on PC0003 (currently running Windows 7 SP1).\n\n1.  On PC0003, start the **Software Center**.\n2.  Select the **Windows vNext Upgrade** task sequence, and then click **Install**.\n\nWhen the task sequence begins, it will automatically initiate the in-place upgrade process by invoking the Windows setup program (Setup.exe) with the necessary command-line parameters to perform an automated upgrade, which preserves all data, settings, apps, and drivers.\n\n![figure 2](images/upgradecfg-fig2-upgrading.png)\n\nFigure 2. Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Enterprise x64 with a task sequence.\n\nAfter the task sequence finishes, the computer will be fully upgraded to Windows 10.\n\n## Upgrade to Windows 10 with the next version of System Center Configuration Manager\n\n\nWith the next release of System Center Configuration Manager (currently planned for Q4 of 2015), new built-in functionality will be provided to make it even easier to upgrade existing Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 PCs to Windows 10.\n\n**Note**  \nFor more details about the next version of Configuration Manager, see the [Configuration Manager Team blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620205). An [evaluation version is currently available](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620206) for you to try. The instructions below are specific to the Technical Preview 2 release and may change after the next version of Configuration Manager is released.\n\n \n\n### Create the OS upgrade package\n\nFirst, you need to create an operating system upgrade package that contains the full Windows 10 Enterprise x64 installation media.\n\n1.

In this section, we assume you have the PC0003 machine running Windows 7 SP1, with the next version of System Center Configuration Manager client installed.\n\n1.  On CM01, using the Configuration Manager console, in the Asset and Compliance workspace, right-click **Device Collections**, and then select **Create Device Collection**. Use the following settings:\n    -   General\n\n        -   Name: Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Upgrade\n\n        -   Limited Collection: All Systems\n\n    -   Membership rules:\n\n        -   Direct rule\n\n            -   Resource Class: System Resource\n\n            -   Attribute Name: Name\n\n            -   Value: PC0003\n\n        -   Select Resources\n\n        -   Select PC0003\n\n2.  Review the Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Upgrade collection. Do not continue until you see the PC0003 machine in the collection.\n\n### Deploy the Windows 10 upgrade\n\nIn this section, you create a deployment for the Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Update application.\n\n1.  On CM01, using the Configuration Manager console, in the Software Library workspace, right-click the **Windows vNext Upgrade** task sequence, and then select **Deploy**.\n2.  On the **General** page, select the **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Upgrade** collection, and then click **Next**.\n3.  On the **Content** page, click **Next**.\n4.  On the **Deployment Settings** page, select the following settings and click **Next**:\n    -   Action: Install\n\n    -   Purpose: Available\n\n5.  On the **Scheduling** page, accept the default settings, and then click **Next**.\n6.  On the **User Experience** page, accept the default settings, and then click **Next**.\n7.  On the **Alerts** page, accept the default settings, and then click **Next**.\n8.  On the **Summary** page, click **Next**, and then click **Close**.\n\n### Start the Windows 10 upgrade\n\nIn this section, you start the Windows 10 Upgrade task sequence on PC0003 (currently running Windows 7 SP1).\n\n1.  On PC0003, start the **Software Center**.\n2.  Select the **Windows vNext Upgrade** task sequence, and then click **Install.**\n\nWhen the task sequence begins, it automatically initiates the in-place upgrade process by invoking the Windows setup program (Setup.exe) with the necessary command-line parameters to perform an automated upgrade, which preserves all data, settings, apps, and drivers.\n\nAfter the task sequence completes, the computer will be fully upgraded to Windows 10.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Windows 10 deployment scenarios](windows-10-deployment-scenarios.md)\n\n[Configuration Manager Team blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620109)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
