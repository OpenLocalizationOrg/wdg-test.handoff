The MED-V client, however, can be installed independently without the MED-V management console by clearing the **Install the MED-V Management application** check box during installation.\n\n**Note**  \nThe MED-V client and MED-V management console can only be installed on Windows 7-, Windows Vista-, and Windows XP-based computers. They cannot be installed on server products.\n\n \n\n**Note**  \nDo not install the MED-V client using the Windows **runas** command.\n\n \n\n**To install the MED-V client**\n\n1.  Log in as a user with local administrator rights on the local computer.\n\n2.  Run the MED-V .msi package.\n\n    The MED-V .msi package is called *MED-V\\_x.msi*, where *x* is the version number.\n\n    For example, *MED-V\\_1.0.65.msi*.\n\n3.  When the **InstallShield Wizard Welcome** screen appears, click **Next**.\n\n4.  On the **License Agreement** screen, read the license agreement, click **I accept the terms in the license agreement**, and click **Next**.\n\n    The **Destination Folder** screen appears, with the default installation folder displayed.\n\n    The default installation folder is the directory where the operating system is installed.\n\n    -   To change the folder where MED-V should be installed, click **Change**, and browse to an existing folder.\n\n5.  Click **Next**.\n\n6.  On the **MED-V Settings** screen, configure the MED-V installation as follows:\n\n    -   Select the **Install the MED-V management application** check box to include the management component in the installation.\n\n        **Note**  \n        Enterprise Desktop Virtualization administrators should install the MED-V management application. This application is required for configuring desktop images and MED-V workspaces.\n\n         \n\n    -   Select the **Load MED-V when Windows starts** check box to start MED-V automatically on startup.\n\n    -   Select the **Add a MED-V shortcut to my desktop** check box to create a MED-V shortcut on your desktop.\n\n    -   In the **Server address** field, type the server address.\n\n    -   In the **Server port** field, type the server's port.\n\n    -   Select the **Server requires encrypted connections (https)** check box to work with https.\n\n    -   The default virtual machine images folder is displayed. The default installation folder is *%systemdrive%\\\\MED-V Images\\\\*. To change the folder where MED-V should be installed, click **Change**, and browse to an existing folder.\n\n7.  Click **Next**.\n\n8.  On the **Ready to Install the Program** screen, click **Install**.\n\n    The MED-V client installation starts. This can take several minutes, and the screen might not display text. During installation, several progress screens appear. If a message appears, follow the instructions provided.\n\n    Upon successful installation, the **InstallShield Wizard Completed** screen appears.\n\n9.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Supported Configurations](supported-configurationsmedv-orientation.md)\n\n[Installation and Upgrade Checklists](installation-and-upgrade-checklists.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
