For information on configuring an image Web distribution server, see [How to Configure the Image Web Distribution Server](how-to-configure-the-image-web-distribution-server.md).\n\nOnce a MED-V image is packed and uploaded to the server, it can be distributed to users by using an enterprise software distribution center, or it can be downloaded by users using a deployment package. For information on deployment using an enterprise software distribution center, see [Deploying a MED-V Workspace Using an Enterprise Software Distribution System](deploying-a-med-v-workspace-using-an-enterprise-software-distribution-system.md). For information on deployment using a package, see [Deploying a MED-V Workspace Using a Deployment Package](deploying-a-med-v-workspace-using-a-deployment-package.md).\n\n**Note**  \nBefore uploading an image, verify that a Web proxy is not defined in your browser settings and that Windows Update is not currently running.\n\n \n\n**To upload a MED-V image to the server**\n\n1.  In the **Local Packed Images** pane, select the image you created.\n\n2.  Click **Upload**.\n\n    The image is uploaded to the server. This might take a considerable amount of time.\n\n    Images on the server are defined with the properties listed in the following table.\n\n**Packed Images on Server Properties**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Property</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Image Name</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The name of the packed image as it was defined when the administrator created the image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Version</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The version of the displayed image.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<strong>Note</strong>  \n<p>All previous versions are kept unless deleted.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n \n</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>File Size (compressed)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The physical compressed size of the image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Image Size (uncompressed)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The physical uncompressed size of the image.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Install MED-V Client and MED-V Management Console](how-to-install-med-v-client-and-med-v-management-console.md)\n\n[Using the MED-V Management Console User Interface](using-the-med-v-management-console-user-interface.md)\n\n[Creating a Virtual PC Image for MED-V](creating-a-virtual-pc-image-for-med-v.md)\n\n[How to Pack a MED-V Image](how-to-pack-a-med-v-image.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
