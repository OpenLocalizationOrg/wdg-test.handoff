to access file system objects.\n\nAudit events are generated only for objects that have configured system access control lists ([SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)s), and only if the type of access requested (such as Write, Read, or Modify) and the account making the request match the settings in the [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\nIf success auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any account successfully accesses a file system object that has a matching SACL. If failure auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any user unsuccessfully attempts to access a file system object that has a matching SACL.\n\nThese events are essential for tracking activity for file objects that are sensitive or valuable and require extra monitoring.\n\n**Event volume**: Varies, depending on how file system [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)s are configured.\n\nNo audit events are generated for the default file system [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)s.\n\nThis subcategory allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects, file system object deletion and permissions change operations and hard link creation actions.\n\nOnly one event, “[4658](event-4658.md): The handle to an object was closed,” depends on the [Audit Handle Manipulation](audit-handle-manipulation.md) subcategory (Success auditing must be enabled). All other events generate without any additional configuration.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | IF              | IF              | IF               | IF               | We strongly recommend that you develop a File System Security Monitoring policy and define appropriate [SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)s for file system objects for different operating system templates and roles.
