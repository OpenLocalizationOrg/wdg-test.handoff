These issues do not appear in the product documentation and in some cases might contradict existing product documentation. When it is possible, these issues will be addressed in later releases.\n\n### Unable to open hyperlinks using Internet Explorer 11 on Microsoft Windows 8.1 within the Virtual Environment\n\nAttempting to open hyperlinks from within a virtual environment will fail on Windows 8.1 using Internet Explorer 11. This is because Internet Explorer 11 now ships with the Enhanced Protection Mode (EPM) enabled by default and this causes App-V to be unable to access required registry keys, files and communication port objects.\n\nWORKAROUND: Disable EPM in Internet Explorer 11 before opening an App-V package. This will allow you to open Internet Explorer from within the virtual environment.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[About Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 SP3](about-microsoft-application-virtualization-46-sp3.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
