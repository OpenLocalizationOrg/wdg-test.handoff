later\n- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)\n\n<span style=\"color:#ED1C24;\">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>\n\nUse the **Settings** menu ![Settings icon](images/settings.png) to configure the time zone, suppression rules, and view license information.\n\n## Time zone settings\nThe aspect of time is important in the assessment and analysis of perceived and actual cyberattacks.\n\nCyberforensic investigations often rely on time stamps to piece together the sequence of events. It’s important that your system reflects the correct time zone settings.\n\nWindows Defender ATP can display either Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local time.\n\nYour current time zone setting is shown in the Windows Defender ATP menu. You can change the displayed time zone in the **Settings** menu ![Settings icon](images/settings.png).\n\n### UTC time zone\nWindows Defender ATP uses UTC time by default.\n\nSetting the Windows Defender ATP time zone to UTC will display all system timestamps (alerts, events, and others) in UTC for all users. Choosing this setting means that all users will see the same timestamps in Windows Defender ATP, regardless of their regional settings. This can help security analysts working in different locations across the globe to use the same time stamps while investigating events.\n\n### Local time zone\nYou can choose to have Windows Defender ATP use local time zone settings. All alerts and events will be displayed using your local time zone.\n\nThe local time zone is taken from your machine’s regional settings. If you change your regional settings, the Windows Defender ATP time zone will also change. Choosing this setting means that the timestamps displayed in Windows Defender ATP will be aligned to local time for all Windows Defender ATP users. Analysts located in different global locations will now see the Windows Defender ATP alerts according to their regional settings.\n\nChoosing to use local time can be useful if the analysts are located in a single location. In this case it might be easier to correlate events to local time, for example – when a local user clicked on a suspicious email link.\n\n### Set the time zone\nThe Windows Defender ATP time zone is set by default to UTC.\nSetting the time zone also changes the times for all Windows Defender ATP views.\nTo set the time zone:\n\n1.  Click the **Settings** menu ![Settings icon](images/settings.png).\n2.  Select the **Timezone:UTC** indicator.\n3.  The time zone indicator changes to **Timezone:Local**. Click it again to change back to **Timezone:UTC**.\n\n## Suppression rules\nThe suppression rules control what alerts are suppressed. You can suppress alerts so that certain activities are not flagged as suspicious. See [Suppress alerts](manage-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#suppress-alerts).\n\n## License\nClick the license link in the **Settings** menu to view the license agreement information for Windows Defender ATP.\n"}
