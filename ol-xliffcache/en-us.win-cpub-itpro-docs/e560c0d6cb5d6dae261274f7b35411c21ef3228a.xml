describes the reports that are available when you are running Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) in the Stand-alone topology.\n\n**Note**  \nIf you are running MBAM with the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you generate reports from Configuration Manager rather than from MBAM. See [Viewing MBAM 2.5 Reports for the Configuration Manager Integration Topology](viewing-mbam-25-reports-for-the-configuration-manager-integration-topology.md) for more information about these reports.\n\n \n\n## Understanding the MBAM Stand-alone topology reports\n\n\nMBAM provides three report types that you can use to monitor your organization for BitLocker compliance:\n\n-   [Enterprise Compliance Report](#bkmk-enterprisecompliance)\n\n-   [Computer Compliance Report](#bkmk-compliance)\n\n-   [Recovery Audit Report](#bkmk-recovery)\n\nTo access MBAM reports when you are running MBAM in the Stand-alone topology, open a web browser, and then open the Administration and Monitoring Website. Select **Reports** in the left menu bar. From the top menu bar, select the kind of report that you want to generate. For more information about generating these reports, see [Generating MBAM 2.5 Stand-alone Reports](generating-mbam-25-stand-alone-reports.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-enterprisecompliance\"></a>Enterprise Compliance Report\n\nUse this report type to collect information about overall BitLocker compliance in your organization.
