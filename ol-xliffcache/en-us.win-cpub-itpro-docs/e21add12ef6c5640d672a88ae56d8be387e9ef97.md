# How to Set MED-V Workspace Deletion Options


## Workspace Deletion Options


The administrator can set the MED-V workspace deletion options for each user or group so that the MED-V workspace is automatically deleted under certain conditions.

**To set MED-V workspace deletion options**

1.  In the **Deployment** pane, click **Workspace deletion options**.

2.  In the **Workspace Deletion Options** dialog box, select from the following options:

    -   
            **The Workspace has been disabled**—If the administrator disables the MED-V workspace, the MED-V workspace is deleted from the user or group computer.

    -   
            **The Workspace has expired**—If the MED-V workspace expires according to the date specified, the MED-V workspace is deleted from the user or group computer.

    -   
            **User is offline for more than the allowed period**—If the policy is not refreshed in the time period specified since the user was offline, the MED-V workspace is deleted from the user or group computer.

3.  Click **OK**.
