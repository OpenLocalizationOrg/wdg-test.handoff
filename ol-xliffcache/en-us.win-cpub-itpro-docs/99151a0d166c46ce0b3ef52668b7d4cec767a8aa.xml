Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 is through an in-place upgrade. You can use a Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 Update 2 task sequence to completely automate the process.\n\n## Proof-of-concept environment\n\nFor the purposes of this topic, we will use four machines: DC01, MDT01, and PC0001. DC01 is a domain controller and MDT01 is a Windows Server 2012 R2 standard machine, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as a member server in the fictional contoso.com domain. PC0001 is a machine with Windows 7 SP1, targeted for the Windows 10 upgrade. For more details on the setup for this topic, please see [Deploy Windows 10 with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](deploy-windows-10-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit.md).\n\n![fig 1](images/upgrademdt-fig1-machines.png)\n\nFigure 1. The machines used in this topic.\n\n## Set up the upgrade task sequence\n\nMDT 2013 Update 2 adds support for Windows 10 deployment, including a new in-place upgrade task sequence template that makes the process really simple.\n\n## Create the MDT production deployment share\n\nThe steps to create the deployment share for production are the same as when you created the deployment share to create the custom reference image:\n\n1.  On MDT01, log on as Administrator in the CONTOSO domain with a password of **P@ssw0rd**.\n2.  Using the Deployment Workbench, right-click **Deployment Shares** and select **New Deployment Share**.\n3.  On the **Path** page, in the **Deployment share path** text box, type **E:\\\\MDTProduction**, and then click **Next**.\n4.  On the **Share** page, in the **Share name** text box, type **MDTProduction$**, and then click **Next**.\n5.  On the **Descriptive Name** page, in the **Deployment share** description text box, type **MDT Production**, and then click **Next**.\n6.  On the **Options** page, accept the default settings and click **Next** twice, and then click **Finish**.\n7.  Using File Explorer, verify that you can access the **\\\\\\\\MDT01\\\\MDTProduction$** share.\n\n## Add Windows 10 Enterprise x64 (full source)\n\nIn these steps we assume that you have copied the content of a Windows 10 Enterprise x64 ISO to the E:\\\\Downloads\\\\Windows 10 Enterprise x64 folder.\n\n1.  Using the Deployment Workbench, expand the **Deployment Shares** node, and then expand **MDT Production**.\n2.  Right-click the **Operating Systems** node, and create a new folder named **Windows 10**.\n3.  Expand the **Operating Systems** node, right-click the **Windows 10** folder, and select **Import Operating System**. Use the following settings for the Import Operating System Wizard:\n    -   Full set of source files\n    -   Source directory: E:\\\\Downloads\\\\Windows 10 Enterprise x64\n    -   Destination directory name: W10EX64RTM\n4.  After you add the operating system, in the **Operating Systems / Windows 10** folder, double-click the added operating system name in the **Operating System** node and change the name to the following: **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 RTM Default Image**\n\n![figure 2](images/upgrademdt-fig2-importedos.png)\n\nFigure 2. The imported Windows 10 operating system after you rename it.\n\n## Create a task sequence to upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise\n\n1.  Using the Deployment Workbench, select **Task Sequences** in the **MDT Production** node, and create a folder named **Windows 10**.\n2.  Right-click the new **Windows 10** folder and select **New Task Sequence**. Use the following settings for the New Task Sequence Wizard:\n    -   Task sequence ID: W10-X64-UPG\n    -   Task sequence name: Windows 10 Enterprise x64 RTM Upgrade\n    -   Template: Standard Client Upgrade Task Sequence\n    -   Select OS: Windows 10 Enterprise x64 RTM RTM Default Image\n    -   Specify Product Key: Do not specify a product key at this time\n    -   Full Name: Contoso\n    -   Organization: Contoso\n    -   Internet Explorer home page: about:blank\n    -   Admin Password: Do not specify an Administrator Password at this time\n\n![figure 3](images/upgrademdt-fig3-tasksequence.png)\n\nFigure 3. The task sequence to upgrade to Windows 10.\n\n## Perform the Windows 10 upgrade\n\nTo initiate the in-place upgrade, perform the following steps on PC0003 (currently running Windows 7 SP1).\n\n1.  Start the MDT deployment wizard by running the following command: **\\\\\\\\MDT01\\\\MDTProduction$\\\\Scripts\\\\LiteTouch.vbs**\n2.  Select the **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 RTM Upgrade** task sequence, and then click **Next**.\n\n    ![figure 4](images/upgrademdt-fig4-selecttask.png)\n\n    Figure 4. Upgrade task sequence.\n    \n3.  On the **Credentials** tab, specify the **MDT\\_BA** account, **P@ssw0rd** password, and **CONTOSO** for the domain. (Some or all of these values can be specified in Bootstrap.ini so they are automatically populated.)\n4.  On the **Ready** tab, click **Begin** to start the task sequence.\nWhen the task sequence begins, it automatically initiates the in-place upgrade process by invoking the Windows setup program (Setup.exe) with the necessary command-line parameters to perform an automated upgrade, which preserves all data, settings, apps, and drivers.\n\n![figure 5](images/upgrademdt-fig5-winupgrade.png)\n\nFigure 5. Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Enterprise x64 with a task sequence.\n\nAfter the task sequence completes, the computer will be fully upgraded to Windows 10.\n\n## Related topics\n\n[Windows 10 deployment scenarios](windows-10-deployment-scenarios.md)\n\n[Microsoft Deployment Toolkit downloads and resources](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618117)\n "}
