Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To request the deletion of a controlled GPO**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab, click the **Controlled** tab to display the controlled GPOs.\n\n3.  Right-click the GPO you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.\n\n    -   To delete the GPO from the archive while leaving the deployed version of the GPO untouched in the production environment, click **Delete GPO from archive only**.\n\n    -   To delete the GPO from both the archive and production environment, click **Delete GPO from archive and production**.\n\n4.  Unless you have special permission to delete GPOs, you must submit a request for deletion of the deployed GPO. To receive a copy of the request, type your e-mail address in the **Cc** field. Type a comment to be displayed in the audit trail for the GPO, and then click **Submit**.\n\n5.  When the **Progress** window indicates that overall progress is complete, click **Close**. The GPO is displayed on the list of GPOs on the **Pending** tab. When an Approver has approved your request, the GPO will be moved from the **Pending** tab to the **Recycle Bin** tab, where it can be restored or destroyed.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Editor to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Edit Settings** permissions for the GPO.\n\n-   To withdraw your request before it has been approved, click the **Pending** tab. Right-click the GPO, and then click **Withdraw**. The GPO will be returned to the **Controlled** tab.\n\n-   To delete an uncontrolled GPO from the production environment without first controlling it, in the **Group Policy Management Console**, click **Forest**, click **Domains**, click **&lt;MyDomain&gt;**, and then click **Group Policy Objects**. Right-click the uncontrolled GPO, and then click **Delete**.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Performing Editor Tasks](performing-editor-tasks-agpm30ops.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
