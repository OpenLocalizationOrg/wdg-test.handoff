Logon\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Logon determines whether the operating system generates audit events when a user attempts to log on to a computer.\n\nThese events are related to the creation of logon sessions and occur on the computer that was accessed. For an interactive logon, events are generated on the computer that was logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a share, events are generated on the computer that hosts the resource that was accessed.\n\nThe following events are recorded:\n\n-   Logon success and failure.\n\n-   Logon attempts by using explicit credentials. This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that account's credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch configurations such as scheduled tasks, or when using the **RunAs** command.\n\n-   Security identifiers (SIDs) are filtered.\n\nLogon events are essential to tracking user activity and detecting potential attacks.\n\n**Event volume**:\n\n-   Low on a client computer.\n\n-   Medium on a domain controllers or network servers.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | Audit Logon events, for example, will give you information about which account, when, using which Logon Type, from which machine logged on to this machine.<br>Failure events will show you failed logon attempts and the reason why these attempts failed. |\n| Member Server     | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | Audit Logon events, for example, will give you information about which account, when, using which Logon Type, from which machine logged on to this machine.<br>Failure events will show you failed logon attempts and the reason why these attempts failed. |\n| Workstation       | Yes             | Yes             | Yes              | Yes              | Audit Logon events, for example, will give you information about which account, when, using which Logon Type, from which machine logged on to this machine.<br>Failure events will show you failed logon attempts and the reason why these attempts failed. |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4624](event-4624.md)(S): An account was successfully logged on.\n\n-   [4625](event-4625.md)(F): An account failed to log on.\n\n-   [4648](event-4648.md)(S): A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.\n\n-   [4675](event-4675.md)(S): SIDs were filtered.\n\n"}
