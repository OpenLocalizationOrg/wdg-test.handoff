# How to Work Offline or Online with Application Virtualization


If you plan to be disconnected from the network for an extended period of time, you can work in offline mode to eliminate possible delays when the Application Virtualization client attempts to communicate with the server. In offline mode, the Application Virtualization client will not attempt to communicate with the publishing server, so applications must be fully cached before enabling offline mode. Applications will not be retrieved from the content share even if they are on the local disk on the computer. You can use the following Application Virtualization Client procedure to toggle between working offline and online.

**Note**  
By default, **Work Offline** is disabled for the Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services). Your system administrator must change your user permissions to allow you to use this setting on a Client for Remote Desktop Services.

 

**To work offline**

-   Right-click the Application Virtualization System icon in the notification area, and select **Work Offline** from the pop-up menu.

**To work online**

-   Right-click the Application Virtualization System icon in the notification area, and select **Work Online** from the pop-up menu.
