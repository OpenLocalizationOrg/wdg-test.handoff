In the left pane of the management console, click the **Applications** node.\n\n2.  In the right pane, highlight one or more applications you want to delete. You can use CTRL or Shift key combinations to highlight multiple applications.\n\n3.  Right-click the application or applications, and choose **Delete**.\n\n4.  In the **Remove Application** confirmation prompt, click **Yes** to complete the action.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Import an Application](how-to-import-an-applicationserver.md)\n\n[How to Manage Applications in the Server Management Console](how-to-manage-applications-in-the-server-management-console.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
