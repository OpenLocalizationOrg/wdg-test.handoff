Many schools use online testing for formative and summative assessments. It's critical that students use a secure browser that prevents them from using other computer or Internet resources during the test. The **Take a Test** app in Windows 10, Version 1607, creates the right environment for taking a test:

- 
            **Take a Test** shows just the test and nothing else.
- Students aren’t able to go to other websites.
- Students can’t open or access other apps.
- Students can't share, print, or record their screens.
- Students can’t copy or paste.
- Students can’t change settings, extend their display, see notifications, get updates, or use autofill features.
- Cortana is turned off.



## How you use Take a Test

![Use test account or test url in Take a Test](images/take-a-test-flow.png)

- 
            **Use a test URL and a dedicated testing account** - A user signs in to the account and the **Take a Test** app automatically launches the pre-configured assessment URL in a single-app, kiosk mode. A student will never have access to the desktop in this configuration. We recommend this configuration for high stakes testing.
- 
            **Put a test URL with an included prefix on a web page or OneNote for students to click** - This allows teachers and test administrators an easier way to deploy assessments. We recommend this method for lower stakes assessments.
