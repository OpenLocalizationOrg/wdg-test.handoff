The package converter uses PowerShell to convert packages and can help automate the process if you have many packages that require conversion.\n\n**Note**  \nApp-V 5.1 packages are exactly the same as App-V 5.0 packages. There has been no change in the package format between the versions and so there is no need to convert App-V 5.0 packages to App-V 5.1 packages.\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-whatsnew\"></a>What’s New in App-V 5.1\n\n\nThese sections are for users who are already familiar with App-V and want to know what has changed in App-V 5.1.

To export the manifest file, select the **Advanced** tab and in the Manifest File box, click **Export...**. You can make changes to the manifest file, such as removing shell extensions or editing file type associations.\n\nAfter you make your changes, click **Import...** and select the file you edited. After you successfully import it back in, the manifest file is immediately updated within the package editor.\n\n**Caution**  \nWhen you import the file, your changes are validated against the XML schema. If the file is not valid, you will receive an error. Be aware that it is possible to import a file that is validated against the XML schema, but that might still fail to run for other reasons.\n\n \n\n### Addition of Windows 10 to operating systems list\n\nIn the Deployment tab, Windows 10 32-bit and Windows 10-64 bit have been added to the list of operating systems for which you can sequence a package. If you select **Any Operating System**, Windows 10 is automatically included among the operating systems that the sequenced package will support.\n\n### Current path displays at bottom of virtual registry editor\n\nIn the Virtual Registry tab, the path now displays at the bottom of the virtual registry editor, which enables you to determine the currently selected key. Previously, you had to scroll through the registry tree to find the currently selected key.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"combined--find-and-replace--dialog-box-and-shortcut-keys-added-in-virtual-registry-editor\"></a>Combined “find and replace” dialog box and shortcut keys added in virtual registry editor\n\nIn the virtual registry editor, shortcut keys have been added for the Find option (Ctrl+F), and a dialog box that combines the “find” and “replace” tasks has been added to enable you to find and replace values and data. To access this combined dialog box, select a key and do one of the following:\n\n-   Press **Ctrl+H**\n\n-   Right-click a key and select **Replace**.\n\n-   Select **View** &gt; **Virtual Registry** &gt; **Replace**.\n\nPreviously, the “Replace” dialog box did not exist, and you had to make changes manually.\n\n### Rename registry keys and package files successfully\n\nYou can rename virtual registry keys and files without experiencing Sequencer issues. Previously, the Sequencer stopped working if you tried to rename a key.\n\n### Import and export virtual registry keys\n\nYou can import and export virtual registry keys. To import a key, right-click the node under which to import the key, navigate to the key you want to import, and then click **Import**. To export a key, right-click the key and select **Export**.\n\n### Import a directory into the virtual file system\n\nYou can import a directory into the VFS. To import a directory, click the **Package Files** tab, and then click **View** &gt; **Virtual File System** &gt; **Import Directory**. If you try to import a directory that contains files that are already in the VFS, the import fails, and an explanatory message is displayed. Prior to App-V 5.1, you could not import directories.\n\n### Import or export a VFS file without having to delete and then add it back to the package\n\nYou can import files to or export files from the VFS without having to delete the file and then add it back to the package. For example, you might use this feature to export a change log to a local drive, edit the file using an external editor, and then re-import the file into the VFS.\n\nTo export a file, select the **Package Files** tab, right-click the file in the VFS, click **Export**, and choose an export location from which you can make your edits.\n\nTo import a file, select the **Package Files** tab and right-click the file that you had exported. Browse to the file that you edited, and then click **Import**. The imported file will overwrite the existing file.\n\nAfter you import a file, you must save the package by clicking **File** &gt; **Save**.\n\n### Menu for adding a package file has moved\n\nThe menu option for adding a package file has been moved. To find the Add option, select the **Package Files** tab, then click **View** &gt; **Virtual File System** &gt; **Add File**. Previously, you right-clicked a folder under the VFS node, and chose **Add File**.\n\n### Virtual registry node expands MACHINE and USER hives by default\n\nWhen you open the virtual registry, the MACHINE and USER hives are shown below the top-level REGISTRY node. Previously, you had to expand the REGISTRY node to show the hives beneath.\n\n### Enable or disable Browser Helper Objects\n\nYou can enable or disable Browser Helper Objects by selecting a new check box, Enable Browser Helper Objects, on the Advanced tab of the Sequencer user interface. If Browser Helper Objects:\n\n-   Exist in the package and are enabled, the check box is selected by default.\n\n-   Exist in the package and are disabled, the check box is clear by default.\n\n-   Exist in the package, with one or more enabled and one or more disabled, the check box is set to indeterminate by default.\n\n-   Do not exist in the package, the check box is disabled.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-pkgconvimprove\"></a>Improvements to Package Converter\n\nYou can now use the package converter to convert App-V 4.6 packages that contain scripts, and registry information and scripts from source .osd files are now included in package converter output.\n\nFor more information including examples, see [Migrating to App-V 5.1 from a Previous Version](migrating-to-app-v-51-from-a-previous-version.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-supmultscripts\"></a>Support for multiple scripts on a single event trigger\n\nApp-V 5.1 supports the use of multiple scripts on a single event trigger for App-V packages, including packages that you are converting from App-V 4.6 to App-V 5.0 or later. To enable the use of multiple scripts, App-V 5.1 uses a script launcher application, named ScriptRunner.exe, which is installed as part of the App-V client installation.\n\nFor more information, including a list of event triggers and the context under which scripts can be run, see the Scripts section in [About App-V 5.1 Dynamic Configuration](about-app-v-51-dynamic-configuration.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-hardcodepath\"></a>Hardcoded path to installation folder is redirected to virtual file system root\n\nWhen you convert packages from App-V 4.6 to 5.1, the App-V 5.1 package can access the hardcoded drive that you were required to use when you created 4.6 packages. The drive letter will be the drive you selected as the installation drive on the 4.6 sequencing machine. (The default drive letter is Q:\\\\.)\n\nPreviously, the 4.6 root folder was not recognized and could not be accessed by App-V 5.0 packages. App-V 5.1 packages can access hardcoded files by their full path or can programmatically enumerate files under the App-V 4.6 installation root.\n\n**Technical Details:** The App-V 5.1 package converter will save the App-V 4.6 installation root folder and short folder names in the FilesystemMetadata.xml file in the Filesystem element. When the App-V 5.1 client creates the virtual process, it will map requests from the App-V 4.6 installation root to the virtual file system root.\n\n## How to Get MDOP Technologies\n\n\nApp-V is a part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP).
