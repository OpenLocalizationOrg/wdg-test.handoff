If you created a virtual application package that contains multiple applications, you should copy all required installation files to a single folder on the computer running the Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer.\n\nThis page contains the following elements:\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"original-installation-files\"></a>**Original Installation Files**  \nClick **Browse** to specify the installation files that were originally used to create the virtual application package. The parent directory you specify should be saved locally to the computer running the Sequencer and must contain all required installation files or subfolders that contain the installation files.
