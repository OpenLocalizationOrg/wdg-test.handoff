# Use the Wizard Complete - Next Steps page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Wizard Complete – Next Steps** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you build your custom installation package, after you click **Finish**.

In most cases, your next steps will be to prepare your files for installation from your network or from another distribution method. If you haven’t already done it, you’ll need to digitally sign any program or .cab files that are going to be distributed over the Internet or over an intranet that isn’t configured to allow downloads.

After that, the steps you’ll use to distribute your customized browser will vary, depending on your version of IEAK (Internal or External) and the media you’re using to distribute the package. For more information, see the [Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) - Deployment Guide for IT Pros](../ie11-deploy-guide/index.md).
