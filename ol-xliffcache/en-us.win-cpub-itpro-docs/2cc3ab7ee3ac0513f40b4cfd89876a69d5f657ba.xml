Delegate Access to the Production Environment\n\n\nIn Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), you can change access to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the production environment of the domain, replacing any existing permissions on those GPOs. You can configure permissions at the domain level to either allow or prevent users from editing, deleting, or modifying the security of GPOs in the production environment when they are not using the **Change Control** folder in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).\n\n**Note**  \n-   Changing how access to the production environment is delegated does not affect users' ability to link GPOs.\n\n-   When GPOs are controlled or deployed, access for any other accounts except those with **Read** and **Apply** permissions is removed.\n\n \n\nA user account that has either the role of AGPM Administrator (Full Control) or the necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To change access to GPOs in the production environment of the domain**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  Click the **Production Delegation** tab.\n\n3.  To add permissions for a user or group that does not have access to the production environment, or to replace the permissions for a user or group that does have access:\n\n    1.  Click **Add**, select a user or group, and then click **OK**.\n\n    2.  Select permissions to delegate to that user or group for the production environment, and then click **OK**.\n\n4.  To remove all permissions to the production environment for a user or group, select the user or group, click **Remove**, and then click **OK**.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **Modify Security** permission for the domain.\n\n-   Permissions for the AGPM Service Account cannot be changed on the **Production Delegation** tab.\n\n-   By default, the following accounts have permissions for GPOs in the production environment:\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Account</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Default Permissions for GPOs</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>&lt;AGPM Service Account&gt;</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Edit Settings, Delete, Modify Security</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Authenticated Users</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Read, Apply</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Domain Admins</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Edit Settings, Delete, Modify Security</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Enterprise Admins</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Edit Settings, Delete, Modify Security</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Enterprise Domain Controllers</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Read</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>System</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Edit Settings, Delete, Modify Security</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n-   Membership in the Group Policy Creator Owners group should be restricted, so it is not used to circumvent AGPM management of access to GPOs. (In the **Group Policy Management Console**, click **Group Policy Objects** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs, click **Delegation**, and then configure the settings to meet the needs of your organization.)\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Configuring Advanced Group Policy Management](configuring-advanced-group-policy-management-agpm40.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
