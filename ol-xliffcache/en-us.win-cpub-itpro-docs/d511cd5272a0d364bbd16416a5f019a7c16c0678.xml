10\n-   Windows Server 2016\n\n\nAudit Process Creation determines whether the operating system generates audit events when a process is created (starts).\n\nThese audit events can help you track user activity and understand how a computer is being used. Information includes the name of the program or the user that created the process.\n\n**Event volume**: Low to Medium, depending on system usage.\n\nThis subcategory allows you to audit events generated when a process is created or starts. The name of the application and user that created the process is also audited.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | It is typically useful to collect Success auditing information for this subcategory for forensic investigations, to find information who, when and with which options\\\\parameters ran specific process. <br>Additionally, you can analyse process creation events for elevated credentials use, potential malicious process names and so on.<br>The event volume is typically medium-high level, depending on the process activity on the computer.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n| Member Server     | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | It is typically useful to collect Success auditing information for this subcategory for forensic investigations, to find information who, when and with which options\\\\parameters ran specific process. <br>Additionally, you can analyse process creation events for elevated credentials use, potential malicious process names and so on.<br>The event volume is typically medium-high level, depending on the process activity on the computer.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n| Workstation       | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | It is typically useful to collect Success auditing information for this subcategory for forensic investigations, to find information who, when and with which options\\\\parameters ran specific process. <br>Additionally, you can analyse process creation events for elevated credentials use, potential malicious process names and so on.<br>The event volume is typically medium-high level, depending on the process activity on the computer.<br>This subcategory doesn’t have Failure events, so there is no recommendation to enable Failure auditing for this subcategory. |\n\n**Events List:**\n\n-   [4688](event-4688.md)(S): A new process has been created.\n\n-   [4696](event-4696.md)(S): A primary token was assigned to process.\n\n"}
