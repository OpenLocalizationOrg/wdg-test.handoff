anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nDescribes the best practices, location, values, policy management and security considerations for the **Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThis policy setting enables or disables the restriction of anonymous access to only those shared folders and pipes that are named in the **Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously** and [Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously](network-access-shares-that-can-be-accessed-anonymously.md) settings. The setting controls null session access to shared folders on your computers by adding RestrictNullSessAccess with the value 1 in the registry key \n**HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\LanManServer\\\\Parameters**. This registry value toggles null session shared folders on or off to control whether the Server service restricts unauthenticated clients' access to named resources.\n\nNull sessions are a weakness that can be exploited through the various shared folders on the devices in your environment.\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   Enabled\n-   Disabled\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   Set this policy to Enabled. Enabling this policy setting restricts null session access to unauthenticated users to all server pipes and shared folders except those listed in the **NullSessionPipes** and **NullSessionShares** registry entries.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\Security Options\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default values for this policy. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| Not defined| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy | Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Enabled| \n| DC Effective Default Settings | Enabled| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Enabled| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings| Enabled| \n \n## Policy management\n\nThis section describes features and tools that are available to help you manage this policy.\n\n### Restart requirement\n\nNone. Changes to this policy become effective without a device restart when they are saved locally or distributed through Group Policy.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nNull sessions are a weakness that can be exploited through shared folders (including the default shared folders) on devices in your environment.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nEnable the **Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares** setting.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nYou can enable this policy setting to restrict null-session access for unauthenticated users to all server pipes and shared folders except those that are listed in the NullSessionPipes and NullSessionShares entries.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Security Options](security-options.md)\n"}
