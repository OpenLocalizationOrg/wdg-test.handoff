VAMT is a standard Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that requires the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) 3.0. VAMT can be installed on any computer that has one of the following Windows operating systems:\n-   Windows® 7\n-   Windows 8\n-   Windows 8.1\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2008 R2\n-   Windows Server® 2012\n-   Windows Server 2012 R2\n\n**Important**  \nVAMT is designed to manage volume activation for: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Office 2013. Computers installed with volume editions of \n**Windows XP** or **Windows Server 2003** cannot be managed using VAMT. However, Office 2010 and Office 2013 products installed on these two operating systems can still be managed.\n\nVAMT is only available in an EN-US (x86) package.\n\n## In this Section\n\n|Topic |Description |\n|------|------------|\n|[Introduction to VAMT](introduction-vamt.md) |Provides a description of VAMT and common usages. |\n|[Active Directory-Based Activation Overview](active-directory-based-activation-overview.md) |Describes Active Directory-Based Activation scenarios. |\n|[Install and Configure VAMT](install-configure-vamt.md) |Describes how to install VAMT and use it to configure client computers on your network. |\n|[Add and Manage Products](add-manage-products-vamt.md) |Describes how to add client computers into VAMT. |\n|[Manage Product Keys](manage-product-keys-vamt.md) |Describes how to add and remove a product key from VAMT. |\n|[Manage Activations](manage-activations-vamt.md) |Describes how to activate a client computer by using a variety of activation methods. |\n|[Manage VAMT Data](manage-vamt-data.md) |Describes how to save, import, export, and merge a Computer Information List (CILX) file using VAMT. |\n|[VAMT Step-by-Step Scenarios](vamt-step-by-step.md) |Provides step-by-step instructions for using VAMT in typical environments. |\n|[VAMT Known Issues](vamt-known-issues.md) |Lists known issues in VAMT. |\n "}
