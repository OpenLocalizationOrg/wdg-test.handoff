Your rating applies to your entire organization and is based on your own testing results and organizational requirements.\n\nPossible ratings include:\n\n-   **Works**. During your organization's testing phase, there were no issues with the application, installation package, or website.\n\n-   **Works with minor issues or has solutions**. During your organization's testing phase, there were no Severity 1 or Severity 2 issues with the application, installation package, or website. For information about severity levels, see [Adding or Editing an Issue](adding-or-editing-an-issue.md).\n\n-   **Does not work**. During your organization's testing phase, the application, installation package, or website experienced a Severity 1 or Severity 2 issue.\n\n-   **No data**. You have no compatibility data to provide.\n\n## Selecting a Compatibility Rating\n\n\nYou can select your compatibility rating from the report screen or from the associated dialog box that shows report details. As an example, the following procedures use the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen. You can alternatively use the **&lt;Application\\_Name&gt;** dialog box. The procedure is the same on the report for websites.\n\n**To select your compatibility rating**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click the application name.\n\n2.  On the **Actions** menu, click **Set Assessment**.\n\n3.  Choose your ratings. Select separate ratings for 32-bit operating systems and 64-bit operating systems, and then click **OK**.\n\n    If your organization does not use a 32-bit operating system, or does not use a 64-bit operating system, you can hide the option in the **Customize Report Views** dialog box. If you hide the option, the associated column no longer appears in the **Set Assessment** dialog box.\n\n## Filtering By Your Compatibility Ratings\n\n\nYou can filter your applications, installation packages, or website data by your compatibility ratings.\n\n**To filter based on your compatibility ratings**\n\n1.  On the **&lt;Operating\\_System&gt; - Application Report** screen, click **Toggle Filter**.\n\n2.  In the **Query Builder**, enter your filter criteria, pressing the Tab key to add additional clauses.\n\n    For example, the following query will show applications with a rating of **Works** or a rating of **Works with minor issues or has solutions**.\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    <col width=\"25%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">And/Or</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Field</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Operator</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Value</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>And</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>My Assessment</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Equals</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Works</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Or</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>My Assessment</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Equals</p></td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Works with minor issues or has solutions</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n     \n\n    To delete a clause, right-click the row, and then click **Delete Clause**.\n\n3.  Click **Refresh**.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
