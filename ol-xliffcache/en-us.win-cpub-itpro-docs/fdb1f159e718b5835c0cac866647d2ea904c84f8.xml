A device is added to an encryption zone by adding the device account to the encryption zone group. Woodgrove Bank has a single service that must be protected, and the devices that are running that service are added to the group CG\\_DOMISO\\_Encryption. This group is granted Read and Apply Group Policy permissions in on the GPO described in this section.\n\nThe GPO is only for server versions of Windows. Client devices are not expected to participate in the encryption zone. If the need for one occurs, either create a new GPO for that version of Windows, or expand the WMI filter attached to one of the existing encryption zone GPOs to make it apply to the client version of Windows.\n\n-   [GPO\\_DOMISO\\_Encryption](gpo-domiso-encryption.md)\n"}
