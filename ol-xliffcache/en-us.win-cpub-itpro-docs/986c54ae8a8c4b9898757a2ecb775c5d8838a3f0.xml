Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) client computers, you need to consider the types of BitLocker protectors that you want to support in your organization, and then configure the corresponding Group Policy settings that you want to apply. This topic describes the Group Policy settings that are available for use when you are using Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring to manage BitLocker Drive Encryption in the enterprise.\n\nMBAM supports the following types of BitLocker protectors for operating system drives: Trusted Platform Module (TPM), TPM + PIN, TPM + USB key, and TPM + PIN + USB key, password, numerical password, and Data Recovery Agent. The password protector is supported only for Windows To Go devices and for Windows 8 devices that do not have a TPM. MBAM supports the TPM + USB key and the TPM + PIN + USB key protectors only when the operating system volume is encrypted before MBAM is installed.\n\nMBAM supports the following types of BitLocker protectors for fixed data drives: password, auto-unlock, numerical password, and Data Recovery Agent.\n\nThe numeric password protector is applied automatically as part of volume encryption and does not need to be configured.\n\n**Important**  \nThe default Windows BitLocker drive encryption Group Policy Object (GPO) settings are not used by MBAM and can cause conflicting behavior if they are enabled. To enable MBAM to manage BitLocker, you must define the MBAM Group Policy settings only after installing the MBAM Group Policy template.\n\n \n\nEnhanced startup PINs can contain characters, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. Unlike BitLocker, MBAM does not support the use of symbols and spaces for enhanced PINs.\n\nInstall the MBAM Group Policy template on a computer that is capable of running the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) MDOP technology. To edit the GPO settings that enable MBAM functionality, you must first install the MBAM Group Policy template, open the GPMC or AGPM to edit the applicable GPO, and then navigate to the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\\\**Policies**\\\\**Administrative Templates**\\\\**Windows Components**\\\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management).**\n\nThe MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management) GPO node contains four global policy settings and four child GPO settings nodes: Client Management, Fixed Drive, Operating System Drive, and Removable Drive. The following sections provide policy definitions and suggested policy settings to assist you in planning for MBAM GPO policy setting requirements.\n\n**Note**  \nFor more information about configuring the minimum, recommended GPO settings to enable MBAM to manage BitLocker encryption, see [How to Edit MBAM 2.0 GPO Settings](how-to-edit-mbam-20-gpo-settings-mbam-2.md).\n\n \n\n## Global Policy Definitions\n\n\nThis section describes MBAM Global policy definitions found at the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\\\**Policies**\\\\**Administrative Templates**\\\\**Windows Components**\\\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Policy Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Overview and Suggested Policy Setting</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to use a specific encryption method and cipher strength.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, BitLocker uses the default encryption method of AES 128-bit with Diffuser or the encryption method specified by the setup script.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Prevent memory overwrite on restart</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to improve restart performance without overwriting BitLocker secrets in memory on restart.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, BitLocker secrets are removed from memory when the computer restarts.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Validate smart card certificate usage rule</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to use smartcard certificate-based BitLocker protection.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, a default object identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.67.1.1 is used to specify a certificate.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Provide the unique identifiers for your organization</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>\n<p>Configure this policy to use a certificate-based data recovery agent or the BitLocker To Go reader.</p>\n<p>When this policy is not configured, the <strong>Identification</strong> field is not used.</p>\n<p>If your company requires higher security measurements, you may want to configure the <strong>Identification</strong> field to make sure that all USB devices have this field set and that they are aligned with this Group Policy setting.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Client Management Policy Definitions\n\n\nThis section describes Client Management policy definitions for Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring found at the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\\\**Policies**\\\\**Administrative Templates**\\\\**Windows Components**\\\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**\\\\**Client Management**.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Policy Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Overview and Suggested Policy Settings</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Configure MBAM Services</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Enabled</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>MBAM Recovery and Hardware service endpoint</strong>.
