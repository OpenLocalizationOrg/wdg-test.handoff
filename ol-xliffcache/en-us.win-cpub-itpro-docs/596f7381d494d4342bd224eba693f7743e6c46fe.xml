Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), you can run different reports in MBAM to monitor BitLocker usage and compliance. MBAM reports compliance and other information about all of the computers and devices it manages. The information in this topic can be used to help you understand the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring reports for enterprise and individual computer compliance and for key recovery activity.\n\n**Note**  \nIf you chose the Configuration Manager topology when you installed Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), reports are generated from Configuration Manager rather than from MBAM. For more information about reports that are run from Configuration Manager, see [Understanding MBAM Reports in Configuration Manager](understanding-mbam-reports-in-configuration-manager.md).\n\n \n\n## Understanding Reports\n\n\nTo access the Reports feature of Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring, open a web browser and open the Administration and Monitoring website. Select **Reports** in the left menu bar and then select from the top menu bar the kind of report that you want to generate.\n\n### Enterprise Compliance Report\n\nUse this report type to collect information on overall BitLocker compliance in your organization. You can use different filters to narrow your search results to Compliance state and Error status.
