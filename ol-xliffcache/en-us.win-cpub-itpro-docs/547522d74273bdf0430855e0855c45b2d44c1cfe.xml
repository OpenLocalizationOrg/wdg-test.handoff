Line\n\n\nThe topics in this section include procedures to install either the Application Virtualization (App-V) Desktop Client or the App-V Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) by using either setup.exe or setup.msi. Administrative rights are required to run either setup program.\n\nYou can use optional command-line parameters to apply specific configuration settings to the App-V client during the installation. For more information about using parameters, see [Application Virtualization Client Installer Command-Line Parameters](application-virtualization-client-installer-command-line-parameters.md). If you have applied registry settings to a computer before deploying a client—for example, by using Group Policy—these settings are retained and any additional command line parameters are applied. Command line parameter values will replace any existing value for the same setting.\n\n**Note**  \nWhen you install the App-V client to use with a read-only cache, for example with a VDI server implementation, you must set the *AUTOLOADTARGET* parameter to NONE to prevent the client from trying to update applications when the cache is read-only.\n\n \n\nFor more information about setting these parameter values after installation, see [How to Configure the App-V Client Registry Settings by Using the Command Line](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169355) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169355) in the Application Virtualization (App-V) Operations Guide.\n\n**Note**  \nIf a configuration setting on the user’s computer depends on the client installation path, note that the Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.5 client copies its installation files to a different folder than previous versions did. By default, a new installation of the App-V 4.5 client will copy its installation files to the \\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Application Virtualization Client folder. If an earlier version of the client is already installed, running the App-V 4.5 client installer will perform an upgrade of the existing client using the existing installation folder.\n\n \n\n\\[Template Token Value\\]\n\n**Note**  \nFor App-V version 4.6 and later, when the App-V client is installed, SFTLDR.DLL is copied to the Windows\\\\system32 directory. If the App-V client is installed on a 64-bit system, SFTLDR\\_WOW64.DLL is copied to the Windows\\\\SysWOW64 directory.\n\n \n\n\\[Template Token Value\\]\n\n## In This Section\n\n\nThe following topics describe how to install either the Application Virtualization (App-V) Desktop Client or the App-V Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) by using either setup.exe or setup.msi.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-the-app-v-client-by-using-setup-exe\"></a>[How to Install the App-V Client by Using Setup.exe](how-to-install-the-app-v-client-by-using-setupexe-new.md)  \nProvides a step-by-step procedure for installing the App-V client by using the setup.exe program.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-install-the-app-v-client-by-using-setup-msi\"></a>[How to Install the App-V Client by Using Setup.msi](how-to-install-the-app-v-client-by-using-setupmsi-new.md)  \nProvides step-by-step procedures for installing any prerequisite software and also the App-V client by using the setup.msi program.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Client Installer Command-Line Parameters](application-virtualization-client-installer-command-line-parameters.md)\n\n[How to Manually Install the Application Virtualization Client](how-to-manually-install-the-application-virtualization-client.md)\n\n[How to Publish a Virtual Application on the Client](how-to-publish-a-virtual-application-on-the-client.md)\n\n[How to Uninstall the App-V Client](how-to-uninstall-the-app-v-client.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
