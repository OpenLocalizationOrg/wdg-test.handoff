To install the App-V Sequencer, see [How to Install the Sequencer](how-to-install-the-sequencer-beta-gb18030.md).\n\n-   Save the .appv file in a secure location and always trust the source before trying to open the package for editing.\n\n-   The Managing Authority section is erroneously removed from the deployment configuration file when you update a package.

The primary feature block is removed from the StreamMap.xml file, and any files that were listed in the publishing feature block are removed. Users who receive the edited package experience that package as if it were stream-faulted, regardless of how the original package was configured.\n\n**Update an application in an existing virtual application package**\n\n1.
