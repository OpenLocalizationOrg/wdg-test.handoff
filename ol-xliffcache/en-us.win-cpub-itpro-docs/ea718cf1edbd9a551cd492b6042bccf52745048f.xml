The primary feature block is removed from the StreamMap.xml file, and any files that were listed in the publishing feature block are removed. Users who receive the edited package experience that package as if it were stream-faulted, regardless of how the original package was configured.\n\n**Update an application in an existing virtual application package**\n\n1.
