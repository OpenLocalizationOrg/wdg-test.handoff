While both provide network access, we recommend you use a wired connection.\n\n## Modifying, adding, or reviewing a network connection\n\n\nIf a wired network connection is not available, the Surface Hub can use a wireless network for internet access. A properly connected and configured Wi-Fi access point must be available and within range of the Surface Hub.\n\n### Choose a wireless access point\n\n1.  On the Surface Hub, open **Settings** and enter your admin credentials.\n2.  Click **System**, and then click **Network & Internet**. Under **Wi-Fi**, choose an access point. If you want Surface Hub to automatically connect to this access point, click **Connect automatically**. Click **Connect**.\n\n    ![](images/networkmgtwireless-01.png)\n\n3.  If the network is secured, you'll be asked to enter the security key. Click **Next** to connect.\n\n    ![](images/networkmgtwireless-02.png)\n\n### Review wireless settings\n\n1.  On the Surface Hub, open **Settings** and enter your admin credentials.\n2.  Click **System**, click **Network & Internet**, then **Wi-Fi**, and then click **Advanced options**.\n\n    ![](images/networkmgtwireless-03.png)\n\n3.
