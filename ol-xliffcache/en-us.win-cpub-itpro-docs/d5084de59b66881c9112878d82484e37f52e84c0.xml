A summary of new alerts is displayed in the **Dashboard**, and you can access all alerts in the **Alerts queue** menu.\n\nSee the [Investigate Windows Defender ATP alerts](investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#investigate-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection-alerts) topic for more details on how to investigate alerts.\n\nClick the **Manage Alert** menu icon ![The menu icon looks like three periods stacked on top of each other](images/menu-icon.png) on the top of the alert to access the Manage Alert menu and manage alerts.\n\n![The manage alert menu lets you change the status of an alert, create suppression rules, or enter comments](images/manage-alert-menu.png)\n\nThe **Manage alert** icon appears on the alert's heading in the **New**, **In Progress**, or **Resolved** queues, and on the details page for individual alerts.\n\nYou can use the **Manage Alert** menu to:\n\n- Change the status of an alert\n- Resolve an alert\n- Suppress alerts so they won't show up in the **Alerts queue** from this point onwards\n- View the history and comments of an alert\n\n## Change the status of an alert\n\nYou can categorize alerts (as **New**, **In Progress**, or **Resolved**) by changing their status as your investigation progresses. This helps you organize and manage how your team can respond to alerts.\n\nFor example, a team leader can review all **New** alerts, and decide to assign them to the **In Progress** queue for further analysis.\n\nAlternatively, the team leader might assign the alert to the **Resolved** queue if they know the alert is benign, coming from a machine that is irrelevant (such as one belonging to a security administrator), or is being dealt with through an earlier alert.\n\n**Change an alert's status:**\n\n1.

This causes the **Resolve conclusion** window to appear, where you can indicate why the alert was resolved and enter any additional comments.\n\n![You can resolve an alert as valid, valid - allowed, or false alarm](images/resolve-alert.png)\n\nThe comments and change of status are recorded in the [Comments and history window](#view-history-and-comments).\n\n![The comments window will display a history of status changes](images/comments.png)\n\n\n## Suppress alerts\n\nWindows Defender ATP lets you create suppression rules so you can limit the alerts you see in the **Alerts queue**.\n\nSuppression rules can be created from an existing alert.\n\nWhen a suppression rule is created, it will take effect from this point onwards. It will not affect existing alerts already in the queue, but new alerts triggered after the rule is created will not be displayed.\n\nThere are two contexts for a suppression rule that you can choose from:\n\n- **Suppress alert on this machine**\n- **Suppress alert in my organization**\n\nThe context of the rule lets you tailor the queue to ensure that only alerts you are interested in will appear. You can use the examples in the following table to help you choose the context for a suppression rule:\n\n**Context** | **Definition** |**Example scenarios**\n---|---|---\n**Suppress alert on this machine** | Alerts with the same alert title and on that specific machine only will be suppressed. <br /><br />All other alerts on that machine will not be suppressed. | <ul><li>A security researcher is investigating a malicious script that has been used to attack other machines in your organization.</li><li>A developer regularly creates PowerShell scripts for their team.</li></ul>\n**Suppress alert in my organization** | Alerts with the same alert title on any machine will be suppressed. | <ul><li>A benign administrative tool is used by everyone in your organization.</li></ul>\n\n\n**Suppress an alert and create a suppression rule:**\n\n1.
