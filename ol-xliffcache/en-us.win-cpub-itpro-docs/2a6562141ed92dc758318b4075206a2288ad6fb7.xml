of an authentication package, notification package, or security package, plus information about trusted logon process registration events.\n\nChanges to security system extensions in the operating system include the following activities:\n\n-   Security extension code is loaded (for example, an authentication, notification, or security package). Security extension code registers with the Local Security Authority and will be used and trusted to authenticate logon attempts, submit logon requests, and be notified of any account or password changes. Examples of this extension code are Security Support Providers, such as Kerberos and NTLM.\n\n-   A service is installed. An audit log is generated when a service is registered with the Service Control Manager. The audit log contains information about the service name, binary, type, start type, and service account.\n\nAttempts to install or load security system extensions or services are critical system events that could indicate a security breach.\n\n**Event volume**: Low.\n\n| Computer Type     | General Success | General Failure | Stronger Success | Stronger Failure | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Domain Controller | Yes             | No              | Yes              | No               | The main reason why we recommend Success auditing for this subcategory is “[4697](event-4697.md)(S): A service was installed in the system.” <br>For other events we strongly recommend monitoring a whitelist of allowed security extensions (authenticated packages, logon processes, notification packages, and security packages).
