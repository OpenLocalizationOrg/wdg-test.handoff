If any failure occurs, the client will automatically switch to disconnected operation. After it is disconnected, if the client needs additional data from the server to continue to run an application or if the disconnected operation time-out expires, the client will attempt to reconnect to the server. If this connection attempt fails, the application will be shut down.\n\nBy default, disconnected operation is enabled and the time-out is set to 90 days. The time-out value is specified as the number of days you want to limit disconnected operation mode, and you can enter a value from 1–999.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[How to Disable or Modify Disconnected Operation Mode Settings](how-to-disable-or-modify-disconnected-operation-mode-settings.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
