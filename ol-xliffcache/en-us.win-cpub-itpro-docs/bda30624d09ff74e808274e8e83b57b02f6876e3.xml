Windows 10 images with provisioning packages\n**Applies to**\n\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows 10 Mobile\n\nUse a provisioning package to apply settings, profiles, and file assets to a Windows 10 image.\n\nIn Windows 10, you can apply a provisioning package at any time. A provisioning package can include management instructions and policies, installation of specific apps, customization of network connections and policies, and more.\n\nYou can include provisioning packages when you build a Windows image. This way, you can create a single provisioning package that you can add to different hardware-specific images.\n\nYou can also put a provisioning package on a USB drive or SD card to apply to off-the-shelf devices. You can even send the provisioning package to someone in email.\n\nRather than wiping a device and applying a new system image when you need to change configuration, you can reset the device to its original state and then apply a new provisioning package.\n\nFor details about the settings you can customize in provisioning packages, see [Windows Provisioning settings reference]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619012).\n\n## Advantages\n-   You can configure new devices without reimaging.\n\n-   Works on both mobile and desktop devices.\n\n-   No network connectivity required.\n\n-   Simple for people to apply.\n\n-   Ensure compliance and security before a device is enrolled in MDM.\n\n## Create package\nUse the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) tool included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10 to create a runtime provisioning package. [Install the ADK.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526740)\n\n1.  Open Windows ICD (by default, `%windir%\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Imaging and Configuration Designer\\x86\\ICD.exe`).\n\n2.  Choose **New provisioning package**.\n\n3.  Name your project, and click **Next**.\n\n4.  Choose **Common to all Windows editions** and click **Next**.\n\n5.  On **New project**, click **Finish**. The workspace for your package opens.\n\n6.  Configure settings. [Learn more about specific settings in provisioning packages.]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615916)\n\n7.  On the **File** menu, select **Save.**\n\n8.  On the **Export** menu, select **Provisioning package**.\n\n9.  Change **Owner** to **IT Admin**, which will set the precedence of this provisioning package higher than provisioning packages applied to this device from other sources, and then select **Next.**\n\n10. Set a value for **Package Version**.\n\n    **Tip**  \n    You can make changes to existing packages and change the version number to update previously applied packages.\n\n11. Optional. In the **Provisioning package security** window, you can choose to encrypt the package and enable package signing.\n\n    -   **Enable package encryption** - If you select this option, an auto-generated password will be shown on the screen.\n\n    -   **Enable package signing** - If you select this option, you must select a valid certificate to use for signing the package. You can specify the certificate by clicking **Select...** and choosing the certificate you want to use to sign the package.\n\n        **Important**  \n        We recommend that you include a trusted provisioning certificate in your provisioning package. When the package is applied to a device, the certificate is added to the system store and any package signed with that certificate thereafter can be applied silently. \n\n12. Click **Next** to specify the output location where you want the provisioning package to go once it's built. By default, Windows ICD uses the project folder as the output location.<p>\nOptionally, you can click **Browse** to change the default output location.\n\n13. Click **Next**.\n\n14. Click **Build** to start building the package. The project information is displayed in the build page and the progress bar indicates the build status.<p>\nIf you need to cancel the build, click **Cancel**. This cancels the current build process, closes the wizard, and takes you back to the **Customizations Page**.\n\n15. If your build fails, an error message will show up that includes a link to the project folder. You can scan the logs to determine what caused the error. Once you fix the issue, try building the package again.<p>\nIf your build is successful, the name of the provisioning package, output directory, and project directory will be shown.\n\n    -   If you choose, you can build the provisioning package again and pick a different path for the output package. To do this, click **Back** to change the output package name and path, and then click **Next** to start another build.\n    \n    -   If you are done, click **Finish** to close the wizard and go back to the **Customizations Page**.\n\n16. Select the **output location** link to go to the location of the package. You can provide that .ppkg to others through any of the following methods:\n\n    -   Shared network folder\n\n    -   SharePoint site\n\n    -   Removable media (USB/SD)\n\n    -   Email\n\n    -   USB tether (mobile only)\n\n    -   NFC (mobile only)\n\n## Add package to image\n**To add a provisioning package to Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education)**\n\n-   Follow the steps in the \"To build an image for Windows 10 for desktop editions\" section in [Use the Windows ICD command-line interface]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617371).\n\n**To add a provisioning package to a Windows 10 Mobile image**\n\n-   Follow the steps in the \"To build an image for Windows 10 Mobile or Windows 10 IoT Core (IoT Core)\" section in [Use the Windows ICD command-line interface]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617371).<p>\nThe provisioning package is placed in the FFU image and is flashed or sector written to the device.
