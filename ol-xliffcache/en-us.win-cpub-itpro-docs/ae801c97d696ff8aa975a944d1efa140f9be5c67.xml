Checklist: Configuring Rules for Servers in a Standalone Isolated Server Zone\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview\n\nThis checklist includes tasks for configuring connection security rules and IPsec settings in your GPOs for servers in a standalone isolated server zone that is not part of an isolated domain. In addition to requiring authentication and optionally encryption, servers in a server isolation zone are accessible only by users or devices that are authenticated as members of a network access group (NAG). The GPOs described here apply only to the isolated servers, not to the client devices that connect to them. For the GPOs for the client devices, see [Checklist: Creating Rules for Clients of a Standalone Isolated Server Zone](checklist-creating-rules-for-clients-of-a-standalone-isolated-server-zone.md).\n\nThe GPOs for isolated servers are similar to those for an isolated domain. This checklist refers you to those procedures for the creation of some of the rules. The other procedures in this checklist are for creating the restrictions that allow only members of the server access group to connect to the server.\n\n**Checklist: Configuring rules for isolated servers**\n\n| Task | Reference |\n| - | - |\n| Create a GPO for the devices that need to have access restricted to the same set of client devices. If there are multiple servers running different versions of the Windows operating system, start by creating the GPO for one version of Windows. After you have finished the tasks in this checklist and configured the GPO for that version of Windows, you can create a copy of it. | [Checklist: Creating Group Policy Objects](checklist-creating-group-policy-objects.md) <br/>[Copy a GPO to Create a New GPO](copy-a-gpo-to-create-a-new-gpo.md)| \n| If you are working on a copy of a GPO, modify the group memberships and WMI filters so that they are correct for the devices for which this GPO is intended. | [Modify GPO Filters to Apply to a Different Zone or Version of Windows](modify-gpo-filters-to-apply-to-a-different-zone-or-version-of-windows.md) |\n| Configure IPsec to exempt all ICMP network traffic from IPsec protection. | [Exempt ICMP from Authentication](exempt-icmp-from-authentication.md)| \n| Create a rule that exempts all network traffic to and from devices on the exemption list from IPsec. | [Create an Authentication Exemption List Rule](create-an-authentication-exemption-list-rule.md) |\n| Configure the key exchange (main mode) security methods and algorithms to be used. | [Configure Key Exchange (Main Mode) Settings](configure-key-exchange-main-mode-settings.md)| \n| Configure the data protection (quick mode) algorithm combinations to be used. | [Configure Data Protection (Quick Mode) Settings](configure-data-protection-quick-mode-settings.md)| \n| Configure the authentication methods to be used. This procedure sets the default settings for the device. If you want to set authentication on a per-rule basis, this procedure is optional.| [Configure Authentication Methods](configure-authentication-methods.md) |\n| Create a rule that requests authentication for all inbound network traffic. <br/><br/>**Important:**  Just as in an isolated domain, do not set the rules to require authentication until your testing is complete.
