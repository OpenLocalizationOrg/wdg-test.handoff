management, and security considerations for the **Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal** security policy setting.\n\n## Reference\n\nThe **Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal** policy setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user’s ticket-granting ticket can be renewed.\n\nThe possible values for this Group Policy setting are:\n\n-   A user-defined number of days from 0 through 99,999\n-   Not defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n-   If the value for this policy setting is too high, users may be able to renew very old user ticket-granting tickets. If the value is 0, ticket-granting tickets never expire.\n\n    It is advisable to set **Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal** to **7** days.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account Policies\\\\Kerberos Policy\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default policy values. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.\n\n| Server type or GPO | Default value |\n| - | - |\n| Default Domain Policy| 7 days| \n| Default Domain Controller Policy| Not defined| \n| Stand-Alone Server Default Settings | Not applicable| \n| Domain Controller Effective Default Settings | 7 days| \n| Member Server Effective Default Settings | Not applicable| \n| Client Computer Effective Default Settings | Not applicable| \n \n### Policy management\n\nThis section describes features, tools, and guidance to help you manage this policy.\n\nA restart of the device is not required for this policy setting to be effective.\n\nThis policy setting is configured on the domain controller.\n\n### Group Policy\n\nClient devices will get the new setting during the next scheduled and successful Group Policy refresh. But for domain controllers to assign these new settings immediately, a gpupdate.exe /force is required. On the local device, the Security Configuration Engine will refresh this setting in about five minutes.\n\nSettings are applied in the following order through a Group Policy Object (GPO), which will overwrite settings on the local computer at the next Group Policy update:\n\n1.  Local policy settings\n2.  Site policy settings\n3.  Domain policy settings\n4.  OU policy settings\n\nWhen a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nThis section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nIf the value for the **Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal** setting is too high, users might be able to renew very old user tickets.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nConfigure the **Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal** setting to 7 days.\n\n### Potential impact\n\nNone. This is the default configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [Kerberos Policy](kerberos-policy.md)\n"}
