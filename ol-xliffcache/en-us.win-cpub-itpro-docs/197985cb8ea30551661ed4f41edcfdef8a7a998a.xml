This is because AppLocker uses this service to verify the attributes of a file.\n \n**To start the Application Identity service automatically using Group Policy**\n\n1.  On the **Start** screen, type **gpmc.msc** to open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).\n2.  Locate the GPO to edit, right-click the GPO, and then click **Edit**.\n3.  In the console tree under **Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings**, click **System Services**.\n4.  In the details pane, double-click **Application Identity**.\n5.  In **Application Identity Properties**, configure the service to start automatically.\n\nMembership in the local **Administrators** group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure.\n\n**To start the Application Identity service manually**\n\n1.  Right-click the taskbar, and click **Task Manager**.\n2.  Click the **Services** tab, right-click **AppIDSvc**, and then click **Start Service**.\n3.  Verify that the status for the Application Identity service is **Running**.\n\nStarting with Windows 10, the Application Identity service is now a protected process. Because of this, you can no longer manually set the service **Startup type** to **Automatic**. \n"}
