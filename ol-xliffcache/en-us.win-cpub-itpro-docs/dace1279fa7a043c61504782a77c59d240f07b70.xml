in the same domain\n\n**Applies to**\n-   Windows 10\n\nThis topic for IT professionals describes concepts and procedures to help you manage your application control strategy using Software Restriction Policies and AppLocker.\n\n## Using AppLocker and Software Restriction Policies in the same domain\n\nAppLocker is supported on systems running Windows 7 and above. Software Restriction Policies (SRP) is supported on systems running Windows Vista or earlier. You can continue to use SRP for application control on your pre-Windows 7 computers, but use AppLocker for computers running \nWindows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 and later. It is recommended that you author AppLocker and SRP rules in separate GPOs and target the GPO with SRP policies to systems running Windows Vista or earlier. When both SRP and AppLocker policies are applied to computers running Windows Server 2008 R2, \nWindows 7 and later, the SRP policies are ignored.\n\nThe following table compares the features and functions of Software Restriction Policies (SRP) and AppLocker.\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Application control function</th>\n<th align=\"left\">SRP</th>\n<th align=\"left\">AppLocker</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Scope</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SRP policies can be applied to all Windows operating systems beginning with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>AppLocker policies apply only to Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, and later.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Policy creation</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>SRP policies are maintained through Group Policy and only the administrator of the GPO can update the SRP policy.
