The solution helps troubleshoot this issue.\n\n**Problems Occur if Installing MED-V for Current User Only.** MED-V only supports the installation of the MED-V Workspace Packager, the MED-V Host Agent, and the MED-V workspace for all users. Installing for the current user only causes failures in the installation of the components and in the setup of the MED-V workspace.\n\n**Solution**\n\nNever use the option **ALLUSERS=””** when installing the MED-V components.\n\n**MED-V Requires Exclusive Use of the Virtualization Stack.** Only one virtualization stack can be run at a time on a computer. Windows Virtual PC must use the virtual stack, and MED-V depends on Windows Virtual PC. Therefore, if you try to deploy or use MED-V when other applications are running that use the virtual stack, MED-V cannot run or be successfully installed.\n\n**Solution**\n\nClose any application that is running that uses the virtualization stack before you install or run MED-V.\n\n**Shortcuts Remain after Uninstall.** By default, when you uninstall MED-V, shortcuts in the end user’s **Start** menu are removed. However, in certain situations, such as for end users who are running roaming profiles, shortcuts to MED-V published applications remain in the end user’s **Start** menu.\n\n**Solution**\n\nTo manually delete the remaining shortcuts on the **Start** menu, right-click the shortcuts, and then click **Remove**.\n\n**Disable Logon Message Group Policy Setting in the MED-V Workspace.** If the Windows XP logon message is enabled in the MED-V workspace, the end user must log on every time they want to open a MED-V virtual application. This creates a poor user experience.\n\n**Solution**\n\nDisable the following Group Policy settings in the MED-V virtual machine:\n\n**Interactive logon: Message text for users attempting to log on**\n\n**Interactive logon: Message title for users attempting to log on**\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Operations Troubleshooting](operations-troubleshooting-medv2.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
