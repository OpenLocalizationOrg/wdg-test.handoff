settings for the user. These settings are then applied to the different computers that are accessed by the user, including desktop computers, laptop computers, and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) sessions.\n\nUE-V offers settings synchronization for common Microsoft applications and Windows settings. It also delivers user settings at any time to wherever users work throughout the enterprise. UE-V allows administrators to specify which application settings and Windows settings roam. UE-V helps administrators to create custom settings location templates for third-party or line-of-business applications that are used in the enterprise.\n\nUser Experience Virtualization delivers an enhanced user state virtualization experience. It provides consistent personalization of the user’s settings in the following scenarios:\n\n-   Roaming user application and Windows settings between computers.\n\n-   Roaming user settings between the instances of an application that are deployed by using different methods:\n\n    -   Installed applications\n\n    -   Application Virtualization (App-V) sequenced applications\n\n    -   RemoteApp (Remote Desktop Virtualization) applications\n\n-   Recovering settings for a computer after replacement, hardware upgrade, or reimage.\n\nThis product requires thorough planning before you deploy it or use its features. Because this product can affect every computer in your organization, you might disrupt your entire network if you do not plan your deployment carefully. However, if you plan your deployment carefully and manage it so that it meets your business needs, this product can help reduce your administrative overhead and total cost of ownership.\n\nIf you are new to this product, we recommend that you read the documentation carefully. Before you deploy the product to a production environment, we also recommend that you validate your deployment plan in a test network environment. You might also consider taking a class about relevant technologies.
