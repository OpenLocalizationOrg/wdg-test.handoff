You need to onboard to Windows Defender ATP before you can use the service.

<!--There are two stages to onboarding:

1.  Set up user access in AAD and use a wizard to create a dedicated
    cloud instance for your network (known as “service onboarding”).

2.  Add endpoints to the service with System Center Configuration Manager, scheduled GP updates, or manual
    registry changes.-->
