Administration and Monitoring Website\n\n\nThe Administration and Monitoring Website, also referred to as the Help Desk, is an administrative interface for BitLocker Drive Encryption. Use the website to review reports, recover end users’ drives, and manage end users’ TPMs, as described in the following sections.\n\n**Note**  \nIf you are using MBAM in the Stand-alone topology, you view all reports from the Administration and Monitoring Website. If you are using the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you view all reports in Configuration Manager, except the Recovery Audit report, which you continue to view from the Administration and Monitoring Website. For more information about reports, see [Monitoring and Reporting BitLocker Compliance with MBAM 2.5](monitoring-and-reporting-bitlocker-compliance-with-mbam-25.md).\n\n \n\n## Required roles for using the Administration and Monitoring Website\n\n\nTo access specific areas of the Administration and Monitoring Website, you must have one of the following roles, which are groups that you create in Active Directory.
