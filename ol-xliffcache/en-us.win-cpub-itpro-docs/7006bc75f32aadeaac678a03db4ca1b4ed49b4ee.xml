Using a firewall program on the server can help reduce the attack surface area. The topics in this section provide procedures for configuring Windows built-in firewall capabilities that support App-V. These procedures assume that you installed a Management Server and that it has been configured for RTSPS communication. Notes are included in the procedures for Streaming Servers and environments where RTSP is being used for communication.\n\n## In This Section\n\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-windows-server-2003-firewall-for-app-v\"></a>[How to Configure Windows Server 2003 Firewall for App-V](how-to-configure-windows-server-2003-firewall-for-app-v.md)  \nProvides a procedure you can use to configure the Windows Server 2003 firewall for App-V.\n\n<a href=\"\" id=\"how-to-configure-windows-server-2008-firewall-for-app-v\"></a>[How to Configure Windows Server 2008 Firewall for App-V](how-to-configure-windows-server-2008-firewall-for-app-v.md)  \nProvides a procedure you can use to configure the Windows Server 2008 firewall for App-V.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
