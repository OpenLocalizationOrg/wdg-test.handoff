#  Install Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) using Microsoft Intune
Internet Explorer 11 is available as an update in Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Intune uses Windows cloud services to help you manage updates, monitor and protect your computers, provide remote assistance, track hardware and software inventory, and set security policies. For more information, see the [Documentation Library for Microsoft Intune](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=301805).

## Adding and deploying the IE11 package
You can add and then deploy the IE11 package to any computer that's managed by Microsoft Intune.

 ![](images/wedge.gif) **To add the IE11 package**

1.  From the Microsoft Intune administrator console, start the Microsoft Intune Software Publisher.

2.  Add your IE11 package as either an external link or as a Windows installer package (.exe or .msi). 

For more info about how to decide which one to use, and how to use it, see [Deploy and configure apps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=301806).
