You can then copy those GPOs for use with the encryption zone. After you create the copies, modify the main rule to require encryption in addition to the authentication required by the rest of the isolated domain.\n\n| Task | Reference |\n| - | - |\n| Make a copy of the domain isolation GPOs to serve as a starting point for the GPOs for the encryption zone.| [Copy a GPO to Create a New GPO](copy-a-gpo-to-create-a-new-gpo.md)| \n| Modify the group memberships and WMI filters so that they are correct for the encryption zone and the version of Windows for which this GPO is intended. | [Modify GPO Filters to Apply to a Different Zone or Version of Windows](modify-gpo-filters-to-apply-to-a-different-zone-or-version-of-windows.md) |\n| Add the encryption requirements for the zone. | [Configure the Rules to Require Encryption](configure-the-rules-to-require-encryption.md)| \n| Link the GPO to the domain level of the Active Directory organizational unit hierarchy. | [Link the GPO to the Domain](link-the-gpo-to-the-domain.md)| \n| Add your test computers to the membership group for the encryption zone.
