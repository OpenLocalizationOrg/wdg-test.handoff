# Deciding Whether to Fix an Application or Deploy a Workaround


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows Server 2008 R2

You can fix a compatibility issue by changing the code for the application or by deploying a workaround.

## Fixing an Application


Fixing an application by changing the code is often the recommended way to address a compatibility issue. Although applying a fix to the code might involve higher initial costs or additional development time, it can limit long-term maintenance or operational costs. After you change the code, all users can use the application without encountering the issue.

If you do not have access to the code, or if you do not have the time and resources to apply a fix, an alternative approach is to deploy a workaround.

## Deploying a Workaround


A workaround involves applying alternative registry settings to address a compatibility issue. Deploying a workaround might be quicker and easier than changing the code, but you can incur long-term maintenance or operational costs. For example, you must make sure that new users have the correct set of features enabled or disabled on their computers. Using a workaround might also make your application or systems less secure. However, the overall security enhancement associated with deploying the newer version of WindowsÂ® may more than offset this reduction in security.

Consider changing registry settings as a short-term solution while you develop the long-term solution of changing the code.
