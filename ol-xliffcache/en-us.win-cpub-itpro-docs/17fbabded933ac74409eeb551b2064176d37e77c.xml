This process requires that the Web server or computer on which the Management Service is installed has a certificate issued to the service or computer.\n\nThe following scenarios illustrate how to obtain a certificate for this purpose:\n\n1.  The company infrastructure already has a public key infrastructure (PKI) in place that automatically issues certificates to computers.\n\n2.  The company infrastructure already has a PKI in place, although it does not automatically issue certificates to computers.\n\n3.  The company infrastructure has no PKI in place.\n\nIn each of the preceding scenarios, the method for obtaining a certificate is different, but the end result is the same. The administrator must assign a certificate to the IIS Default Web Site and configure the App-V Web Management Service to require secure communications.\n\n**Important**  \nThe name of the certificate must match the name of the server. It is a best practice to use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for the common name of the certificate.\n\n \n\nApp-V can use IIS servers to support different infrastructure configurations.
