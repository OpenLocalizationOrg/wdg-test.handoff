You can think of this sample scenario as a case study that helps put the individual scenarios and procedures in context.\n\nThis section provides basic information and directions for planning you MED-V deployment as an end-to-end solution in your enterprise.\n\n## MED-V Planning Step-by-Step Scenario\n\n\nThe topics in this step-by-step scenario include the following:\n\n-   [High-Level Architecture](high-level-architecturemedv2.md) discusses the high-level system architecture and component design of MED-V 2.0. MED-V enhances Windows Virtual PC to run two operating systems on one device, adding virtual image delivery, Group Policy-based provisioning, and centralized management. By using MED-V, you can easily configure, deploy, and manage corporate Windows Virtual PC images on any Windows-based desktop running Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Windows 7 Ultimate.\n\n-   [Define and Plan your MED-V Deployment](define-and-plan-your-med-v-deployment.md) discusses the considerations for planning your MED-V 2.0 deployment. This topic provides direction about identifying the systems in your enterprise that receive MED-V and calculating disk space requirements. This topic also helps evaluate your existing infrastructure and determines how it can be used for MED-V deployment.\n\n-   [MED-V 2.0 Best Practices](med-v-20-best-practices.md) discusses the recommended best practices for planning, installing, deploying, and managing MED-V 2.0 in your environment. These best practices include recommendations that produce faster run times, better operability during first time setup, increased performance, and better virtual machine management.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Planning for MED-V](planning-for-med-v.md)\n\n[End-to-End Deployment Scenario for MED-V 2.0](end-to-end-deployment-scenario-for-med-v-20.md)\n\n[End-to-End Operations Scenario for MED-V 2.0](end-to-end-operations-scenario-for-med-v-20.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
