If the schema for an ACT database does not match the current schema, you can migrate the compatibility data to a new database. You can then use the current version of ACT to open the new database.\n\nTo create the new database, you must have database-creation permissions on the instance of SQL Server.\n\n## Migrating Compatibility Data from an ACT Database\n\n\nYou can migrate compatibility data from an ACT database to a new database by using one of the following methods:\n\n-   Run Application Compatibility Manager (ACM), and then use the ACT Configuration Wizard to open the database. The wizard guides you through migrating the compatibility data to a new database.\n\n-   Run the MigrateDB.sql file, located at %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Application Compatibility Toolkit\\\\MigrateDB.sql.. The following table shows the location of the MigrateDB.sql file.\n\n## Database Migration from ACT 5.6\n\n\nWhen you migrate compatibility data from an ACT 5.6 database to a new database, the following information is excluded from the migration:\n\n-   Issues that were reported by ACT 5.6 data-collection packages (DCPs).\n\n-   Solutions that correspond to issues reported by ACT 5.6 DCPs.\n\n-   Lists of file names that ACT 5.6 associated with each application.\n\nYou cannot migrate any compatibility data from ACT databases that were created on a version of ACT before ACT 5.6.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[ACT Tools, Packages, and Services](act-tools-packages-and-services.md)\n\n[ACT Deployment Options](act-deployment-options.md)\n\n[ACT Database Configuration](act-database-configuration.md)\n\n[ACT LPS Share Permissions](act-lps-share-permissions.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
