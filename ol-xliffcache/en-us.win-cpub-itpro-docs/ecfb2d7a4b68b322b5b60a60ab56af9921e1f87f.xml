function, location, and effect of each Group Policy setting that is used to manage BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\nTo control what drive encryption tasks the user can perform from the Windows Control Panel or to modify other configuration options, you can use Group Policy administrative templates or local computer policy settings. How you configure these policy settings depends on how you implement BitLocker and what level of user interaction will be allowed.\n\n>**Note:**  A separate set of Group Policy settings supports the use of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). For details about those settings, see [Trusted Platform Module Group Policy settings](trusted-platform-module-services-group-policy-settings.md).\n \nBitLocker Group Policy settings can be accessed using the Local Group Policy Editor and the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) under **Computer Configuration\\\\Administrative Templates\\\\Windows Components\\\\BitLocker Drive Encryption**.\nMost of the BitLocker Group Policy settings are applied when BitLocker is initially turned on for a drive. If a computer is not compliant with existing Group Policy settings, BitLocker may not be turned on or modified until the computer is in a compliant state. When a drive is out of compliance with Group Policy settings (for example, if a Group Policy setting was changed after the initial BitLocker deployment in your organization, and then the setting was applied to previously encrypted drives), no change can be made to the BitLocker configuration of that drive except a change that will bring it into compliance.\n\nIf multiple changes are necessary to bring the drive into compliance, you must suspend BitLocker protection, make the necessary changes, and then resume protection. This situation could occur, for example, if a removable drive was initially configured to be unlocked with a password and then Group \nPolicy settings are changed to disallow passwords and require smart cards. In this situation, you need to suspend BitLocker protection by using the [Manage-bde](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff829849.aspx) command-line tool, delete the password unlock method, and add the smart card method. After this is complete, BitLocker is compliant with the Group Policy setting and BitLocker protection on the drive can be resumed.\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-gptop\"></a>BitLocker Group Policy settings\n\nThe following sections provide a comprehensive list of BitLocker Group Policy settings that are organized by usage. BitLocker Group Policy settings include settings for specific drive types (operating system drives, fixed data drives, and removable data drives) and settings that are applied to all drives.\n\nThe following policy settings can be used to determine how a BitLocker-protected drive can be unlocked.\n\n-   [Allow network unlock at startup](#bkmk-netunlock)\n-   [Require additional authentication at startup](#bkmk-unlockpol1)\n-   [Allow enhanced PINs for startup](#bkmk-unlockpol2)\n-   [Configure minimum PIN length for startup](#bkmk-unlockpol3)\n-   [Disallow standard users from changing the PIN or password](#bkmk-dpinchange)\n-   [Configure use of passwords for operating system drives](#bkmk-ospw)\n-   [Require additional authentication at startup (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)](#bkmk-unlockpol4)\n-   [Configure use of smart cards on fixed data drives](#bkmk-unlockpol5)\n-   [Configure use of passwords on fixed data drives](#bkmk-unlockpol6)\n-   [Configure use of smart cards on removable data drives](#bkmk-unlockpol7)\n-   [Configure use of passwords on removable data drives](#bkmk-unlockpol8)\n-   [Validate smart card certificate usage rule compliance](#bkmk-unlockpol9)\n-   [Enable use of BitLocker authentication requiring preboot keyboard input on slates](#bkmk-slates)\n\nThe following policy settings are used to control how users can access drives and how they can use BitLocker on their computers.\n\n-   [Deny write access to fixed drives not protected by BitLocker](#bkmk-driveaccess1)\n-   [Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker](#bkmk-driveaccess2)\n-   [Control use of BitLocker on removable drives](#bkmk-driveaccess3)\n\nThe following policy settings determine the encryption methods and encryption types that are used with BitLocker.\n\n-   [Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength](#bkmk-encryptmeth)\n-   [Configure use of hardware-based encryption for fixed data drives](#bkmk-hdefxd)\n-   [Configure use of hardware-based encryption for operating system drives](#bkmk-hdeosd)\n-   [Configure use of hardware-based encryption for removable data drives](#bkmk-hderdd)\n-   [Enforce drive encryption type on fixed data drives](#bkmk-detypefdd)\n-   [Enforce drive encryption type on operating system drives](#bkmk-detypeosd)\n-   [Enforce drive encryption type on removable data drives](#bkmk-detyperdd)\n\nThe following policy settings define the recovery methods that can be used to restore access to a BitLocker-protected drive if an authentication method fails or is unable to be used.\n\n-   [Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered](#bkmk-rec1)\n-   [Choose how users can recover BitLocker-protected drives (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)](#bkmk-rec2)\n-   [Store BitLocker recovery information in Active Directory Domain Services (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)](#bkmk-rec3)\n-   [Choose default folder for recovery password](#bkmk-rec4)\n-   [Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered](#bkmk-rec6)\n-   [Choose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recovered](#bkmk-rec7)\n-   [Configure the pre-boot recovery message and URL](#bkmk-configurepreboot)\n\nThe following policies are used to support customized deployment scenarios in your organization.\n\n-   [Allow Secure Boot for integrity validation](#bkmk-secboot)\n-   [Provide the unique identifiers for your organization](#bkmk-depopt1)\n-   [Prevent memory overwrite on restart](#bkmk-depopt2)\n-   [Configure TPM platform validation profile for BIOS-based firmware configurations](#bkmk-tpmbios)\n-   [Configure TPM platform validation profile (Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2)](#bkmk-depopt3)\n-   [Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations](#bkmk-tpmvaluefi)\n-   [Reset platform validation data after BitLocker recovery](#bkmk-resetrec)\n-   [Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile](#bkmk-enbcd)\n-   [Allow access to BitLocker-protected fixed data drives from earlier versions of Windows](#bkmk-depopt4)\n-   [Allow access to BitLocker-protected removable data drives from earlier versions of Windows](#bkmk-depopt5)\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-netunlock\"></a>Allow network unlock at startup\n\nThis policy controls a portion of the behavior of the Network Unlock feature in BitLocker. This policy is required to enable BitLocker Network Unlock on a network because it allows clients running BitLocker to create the necessary network key protector during encryption. This policy is used in addition to the BitLocker Drive Encryption Network Unlock Certificate security policy (located in the **Public Key Policies** folder of Local Computer Policy) to allow systems that are connected to a trusted network to properly utilize the Network Unlock feature.\n \n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy description</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>With this policy setting, you can control whether a BitLocker-protected computer that is connected to a trusted local area network and joined to a domain can create and use network key protectors on TPM-enabled computers to automatically unlock the operating system drive when the computer is started.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Introduced</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Drive type</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Operating system drives</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy path</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\BitLocker Drive Encryption\\Operating System Drives</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Conflicts</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>None</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>When enabled</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Clients configured with a BitLocker Network Unlock certificate can create and use Network Key Protectors.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>When disabled or not configured</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Clients cannot create and use Network Key Protectors</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n \n**Reference**\n\nTo use a network key protector to unlock the computer, the computer and the server that hosts BitLocker Drive Encryption Network Unlock must be provisioned with a Network Unlock certificate. The Network Unlock certificate is used to create a network key protector and to protect the information exchange with the server to unlock the computer. You can use the Group Policy setting **Computer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Public Key Policies\\\\BitLocker Drive Encryption Network Unlock Certificate** on the domain controller to distribute this certificate to computers in your organization. This unlock method uses the TPM on the computer, so computers that do not have a TPM cannot create network key protectors to automatically unlock by using Network Unlock.\n\n>**Note:**  For reliability and security, computers should also have a TPM startup PIN that can be used when the computer is disconnected from the wired network or cannot connect to the domain controller at startup.\n \nFor more information about Network Unlock, see [BitLocker: How to enable Network Unlock](bitlocker-how-to-enable-network-unlock.md).\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-unlockpol1\"></a>Require additional authentication at startup\n\nThis policy setting is used to control which unlock options are available for operating system drives.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy description</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>With this policy setting, you can configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

In this mode, a USB drive is required for startup. Key information that is used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, which creates a USB key. When the USB key is inserted, access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable, you need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.\n\nOn a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use:\n\n-   only the TPM for authentication\n-   insertion of a USB flash drive containing the startup key\n-   the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN)\n-   a combination of the PIN and the USB flash drive\n\nThere are four options for TPM-enabled computers or devices:\n\n-   Configure TPM startup\n\n    -   Allow TPM\n    -   Require TPM\n    -   Do not allow TPM\n-   Configure TPM startup PIN\n\n    -   Allow startup PIN with TPM\n    -   Require startup PIN with TPM\n    -   Do not allow startup PIN with TPM\n-   Configure TPM startup key\n\n    -   Allow startup key with TPM\n    -   Require startup key with TPM\n    -   Do not allow startup key with TPM\n-   Configure TPM startup key and PIN\n\n    -   Allow TPM startup key with PIN\n    -   Require startup key and PIN with TPM\n    -   Do not allow TPM startup key with PIN\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-unlockpol2\"></a>Allow enhanced PINs for startup\n\nThis policy setting permits the use of enhanced PINs when you use an unlock method that includes a PIN.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy description</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>With this policy setting, you can configure whether enhanced startup PINs are used with BitLocker.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Introduced</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Drive type</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Operating system drives</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy path</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\BitLocker Drive Encryption\\Operating System Drives</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Conflicts</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>None</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>When enabled</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>All new BitLocker startup PINs that are set will be enhanced PINs.

In a similar manner, BitLocker updates the BitLocker To Go Reader only when the identification field on the drive matches the value that is configured for the identification field.\n\nFor more information about the tool to manage BitLocker, see [Manage-bde](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff829849.aspx).\n\nThe allowed identification field is used in combination with the **Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker** policy setting to help control the use of removable drives in your organization. It is a comma-separated list of identification fields from your organization or external organizations.\n\nYou can configure the identification fields on existing drives by using the [Manage-bde](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff829849.aspx) command-line tool.\n\nWhen a BitLocker-protected drive is mounted on another BitLocker-enabled computer, the identification field and the allowed identification field are used to determine whether the drive is from an outside organization.\n\nMultiple values separated by commas can be entered in the identification and allowed identification fields. The identification field can be any value up to 260 characters.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-depopt2\"></a>Prevent memory overwrite on restart\n\nThis policy setting is used to control whether the computer's memory will be overwritten the next time the computer is restarted.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy description</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>With this policy setting, you can control computer restart performance at the risk of exposing BitLocker secrets.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Introduced</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows Vista</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Drive type</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>All drives</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Policy path</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\BitLocker Drive Encryption</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Conflicts</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>None</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>When enabled</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The computer will not overwrite memory when it restarts.

You must be an administrator to perform these procedures.\n\nFor more information about setting this policy, see [System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj852197.aspx).\n\n## Power management Group Policy settings: Sleep and Hibernate\n\nPCs default power settings for a computer will cause the computer to enter Sleep mode frequently to conserve power when idle and to help extend the system’s battery life. When a computer transitions to Sleep, open programs and documents are persisted in memory. When a computer resumes from Sleep, users are not required to re-authenticate with a PIN or USB startup key to access encrypted data. This might lead to conditions where data security is compromised.\n\nHowever, when a computer hibernates the drive is locked, and when it resumes from hibernation the drive is unlocked, which means that users will need to provide a PIN or a startup key if using multifactor authentication with BitLocker. Therefore, organizations that use BitLocker may want to use Hibernate instead of Sleep for improved security. This setting does not have an impact on TPM-only mode, because it provides a transparent user experience at startup and when resuming from the Hibernate states.\n\nYou can use disable the following Group Policy settings, which are located in **Computer Configuration\\\\Administrative Templates\\\\System\\\\Power Management** to disable all available sleep states:\n\n-   Allow Standby States (S1-S3) When Sleeping (Plugged In)\n-   Allow Standby States (S1-S3) When Sleeping (Battery)\n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-pcr\"></a>About the Platform Configuration Register (PCR)\n\nA platform validation profile consists of a set of PCR indices that range from 0 to 23. The scope of the values can be specific to the version of the operating system.\n\nChanging from the default platform validation profile affects the security and manageability of your computer. BitLocker’s sensitivity to platform modifications (malicious or authorized) is increased or decreased depending on inclusion or exclusion (respectively) of the PCRs.\n\n**About PCR 7**\n\nPCR 7 measures the state of Secure Boot. With PCR 7, BitLocker can leverage Secure Boot for integrity validation. Secure Boot ensures that the computer's preboot environment loads only firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers. PCR 7 measurements indicate whether Secure Boot is on and which keys are trusted on the platform. If Secure Boot is on and the firmware measures PCR 7 correctly per the UEFI specification, BitLocker can bind to this information rather than to PCRs 0, 2, and 4 which have the measurements of the exact firmware and Bootmgr images loaded. This \nreduces the likelihood of BitLocker starting in recovery mode as a result of firmware and image updates, and it provides you with greater flexibility to manage the preboot configuration.\n\nPCR 7 measurements must follow the guidance that is described in [Appendix A Trusted Execution Environment EFI Protocol](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj923068.aspx).\n\nPCR 7 measurements are a mandatory logo requirement for systems that support InstantGo (also known as Always On, Always Connected PCs), such as the Microsoft Surface RT. On such systems, if the TPM with PCR 7 measurement and Secure Boot are correctly configured, BitLocker binds to PCR 7 and PCR 11 by default.\n\n## See also\n- [Trusted Platform Module](trusted-platform-module-overview.md)\n- [TPM Group Policy settings](trusted-platform-module-services-group-policy-settings.md)\n- [BitLocker frequently asked questions (FAQ)](bitlocker-frequently-asked-questions.md)\n- [BitLocker overview](bitlocker-overview.md)\n- [Prepare your organization for BitLocker: Planning and policies](prepare-your-organization-for-bitlocker-planning-and-policies.md)\n"}
