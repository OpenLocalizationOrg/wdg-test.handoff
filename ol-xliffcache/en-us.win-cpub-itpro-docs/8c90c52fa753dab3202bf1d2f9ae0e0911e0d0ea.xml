In an environment where multiple domains are managed with the GPMC, each domain is listed under the **Domains** folder in the console tree. Each domain has a **Change Control** folder under it, and there is one archive of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) per domain.\n\nWithin the details pane there are four primary tabs, providing access to both GPO-level settings and domain-level settings and commands for AGPM. Additionally, there are Administrative template settings specific to AGPM.\n\n-   [Contents Tab](contents-tab-agpm40.md): GPO settings and commands and GPO-level delegation\n\n-   [Domain Delegation Tab](domain-delegation-tab-agpm40.md): AGPM e-mail notification settings and domain-level delegation\n\n-   [AGPM Server Tab](agpm-server-tab-agpm40.md): Domain-level archive connection settings\n\n-   [Production Delegation Tab](production-delegation-tab-agpm40.md): Production environment delegation\n\n-   [Administrative Templates Folder](administrative-templates-folder-agpm40.md): Central configuration of logging and tracking, archive locations, and the visibility of features\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
