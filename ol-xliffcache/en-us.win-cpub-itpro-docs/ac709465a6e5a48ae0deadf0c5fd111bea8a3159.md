# Planning for MBAM 2.5 Server Deployment


This topic lists the features that you deploy for the MBAM Stand-alone and Configuration Manager topologies and lists the order in which you need to deploy them. There is a recommended configuration for each topology. However, you can configure MBAM server databases and features in different configurations and across multiple servers, depending on your scalability requirements.

## Important planning considerations for both topologies

For the Stand-alone topology, a two-server configuration is recommended for production environments, although configurations of three to four servers can be used.

The Server infrastructure for the MBAM Stand-alone topology contains the following features, which must be configured in the order listed:

1.  Databases (Compliance and Audit Database and Recovery Database)

2.  Reports

3.  Web applications (and their corresponding web services)

    -   Administration and Monitoring Website

    -   Self-Service Portal

For a description of these features, see [High-Level Architecture of MBAM 2.5 with Stand-alone Topology](high-level-architecture-of-mbam-25-with-stand-alone-topology.md).

## <a href="" id="planning-for-mbam-server-deployment---configuration-manager-topology"></a>Planning for MBAM Server deployment – Configuration Manager topology


For the Configuration Manager Integration topology, a three-server configuration is recommended for production environments, although configurations of additional servers can be used.

The Server infrastructure for the MBAM Configuration Manager topology contains the following features, which must be configured or performed in the order listed:

1.  Databases (Compliance and Audit Database and Recovery Database)

2.  Reports

3.  Web applications (and their corresponding web services)

    -   Administration and Monitoring Website

    -   Self-Service Portal

4.  System Center Configuration Manager Integration

For a description of these features, see [High-Level Architecture of MBAM 2.5 with Configuration Manager Integration Topology](high-level-architecture-of-mbam-25-with-configuration-manager-integration-topology.md).
