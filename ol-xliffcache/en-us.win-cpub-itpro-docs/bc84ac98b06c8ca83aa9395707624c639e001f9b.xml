This Management Pack supports only Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.5 servers; it does not support previous server versions. The Management Pack maximizes App-V Server availability for handling App-V Client requests.\n\n## Status Indicators\n\n\nThe App-V Server health status indicators are color-coded. The colors represent the following status values:\n\n-   No color indicates that the server is running without non-recoverable errors.\n\n-   Yellow indicates that one of the components is not functioning correctly. The overall functionality of the server is degraded, but the server is still available.\n\n-   Red indicates that the server is not available and that it cannot provide key services or communicate with external service dependencies.\n\n## Monitoring Criteria\n\n\nThe Management Pack monitors the following aspects of server health:\n\n-   Server Status—monitors server events to validate that the server is providing its expected services.\n\n-   Data Store Access—tracks the ability of one or more of the App-V Management Servers to access and communicate with the App-V data store.\n\n-   Content Data Access—monitors access to the \\\\Content directory, which might be a local directory or a network share, and the ability to read the requested files.\n\n-   Security—reports errors with the App-V Server’s certificate and secure communications.\n\n-   Client Request Handling—monitors the ability of one or more of the App-V Servers to handle and correctly respond to client requests. These requests include publishing such items as configuration requests, package load requests, and out of sequence requests.\n\n-   Server Configuration—checks the configuration settings of the App-V Server. These configuration settings include the settings in the registry and in the App-V data store.\n\n## Server Differences\n\n\nThe main differences between the App-V Management Server and the App-V Streaming Server are as follows:\n\n-   App-V Management Servers can provide publishing, streaming, management, and reporting services. Therefore, the Management Pack can manage more aspects of the App-V Management Server than it can manage on the App-V Streaming Server, which provides only package streaming.\n\n-   The App-V Streaming Server does not have an App-V data store, so data store access is not monitored. The configuration information for the App-V Streaming Server is managed in the registry.\n\n-   The App-V Streaming Server does not use the App-V Server Management Console interface; use other tools to manage the configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[Application Virtualization Server](application-virtualization-server.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
