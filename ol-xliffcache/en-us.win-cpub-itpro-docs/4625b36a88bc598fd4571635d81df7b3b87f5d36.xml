On the server where System Center Configuration Manager is deployed, open **Control Panel**. Select the program that is used to uninstall or change a program. Verify that **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** appears in the list of programs and features.\n\n    **Note**  \n    To validate the installation, you must use a domain account that has local computer administrative credentials on each server.\n\n     \n\n2.  Use the Configuration Manager console to confirm that a new collection, called “MBAM Supported Computers,” is displayed.\n\n    To view the collection with Configuration Manager 2007: Click **Site Database** (&lt;**SiteCode**&gt; - &lt;**ServerName**&gt;, &lt;**SiteName**&gt;), **Computer Management**.\n\n    To view the collection with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager: Click the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, **Device Collections**.\n\n3.  Use the Configuration Manager console to verify that the following reports are listed in the **MBAM** folder:\n\n    -   BitLocker Computer Compliance\n\n    -   BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard\n\n    -   BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details\n\n    -   BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Summary\n\n    To view the reports with Configuration Manager 2007: Click **Reporting**, **Reporting Services**, \\\\\\\\&lt;**ServerName**&gt;, **Report Folders**\n\n    To view the reports with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager: Click the **Monitoring** workspace, **Reporting**, **Reports**.\n\n4.
