The report capabilities of Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) can assist an Approver with evaluating a new version of a GPO.\n\nA user account with the Approver or AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role or necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To approve or reject a pending request**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  On the **Contents** tab, click the **Pending** tab to display the pending GPOs.\n\n3.  Right-click a pending GPO, and then click either **Approve** or **Reject**.\n\n4.  If approving deployment, click **Advanced** in the **Approve Pending Operation** dialog box to review links to the GPO. Pause the mouse pointer on a node in the tree to display details.\n\n    -   By default, all links to the GPO will be restored.\n\n    -   To prevent a link from being restored, clear the check box for that link.\n\n    -   To prevent all links from being restored, clear the **Restore Links** check box in the **Deploy GPO** dialog box.\n\n5.  Click **Yes** or **OK** to confirm approval or rejection of the pending action. If you have approved the request, the GPO is moved to the appropriate tab for the action performed.\n\n    **Note**  \n    If an Approver's e-mail address is included in the **To** field on the **Domain** **Delegation** tab, the Approver will receive e-mail from the AGPM alias when an Editor or Reviewer submits a request.\n\n     \n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an Approver or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have the permissions required to perform the request that you are approving.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Performing Approver Tasks](performing-approver-tasks.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
