# How to Delete a Package


You can use the following procedure to delete a package, including all versions of the package, from the Application Virtualization Server Management Console. You might do this for easier management of files on the server or to remove a package and replace it with a more stable one.

**Important**  
When you choose to delete a package, a confirmation box reminds you that this action deletes all its versions. The server will no longer be able to stream the application.

 

**To delete a package**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, expand **Packages**.

2.  In the menu tree pane, right-click the package you want to delete and choose **Delete**.

3.  Read the confirmation window, and click **Yes** to complete the action.
