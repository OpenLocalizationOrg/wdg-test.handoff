# Protect your enterprise data using enterprise data protection (EDP)
**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10 Insider Preview
-   Windows 10 Mobile Preview

<span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product, which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>

With the increase of employee-owned devices in the enterprise, there’s also an increasing risk of accidental data leak through apps and services, like email, social media, and the public cloud, which are outside of the enterprise’s control. For example, when an employee sends the latest engineering pictures to their personal email account, copies and pastes product info into a tweet, or saves an in-progress sales report to their public cloud storage.

Enterprise data protection (EDP) helps to protect against this potential data leakage without otherwise interfering with the employee experience. EDP also helps to protect enterprise apps and data against accidental data leak on enterprise-owned devices and personal devices that employees bring to work without requiring changes to your environment or other apps. Finally, another data protection technology, Azure Rights Management also works alongside EDP to extend data protection for data that leaves the device, such as when email attachments are sent from an enterprise-aware version of a rights management mail client.

## Prerequisites
You’ll need this software to run EDP in your enterprise:

|Operating system | Management solution |
|-----------------|---------------------|
|Windows 10 Insider Preview | Microsoft Intune<br>-OR-<br>System Center Configuration Manager (version 1511 or later)<br>-OR-<br>Your current company-wide 3rd party mobile device management (MDM) solution. For info about 3rd party MDM solutions, see the documentation that came with your product. If your 3rd party MDM does not have UI support for the policies, refer to the [EnterpriseDataProtection CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt697634.aspx) documentation.|

## How EDP works
EDP helps address your everyday challenges in the enterprise. Including:

- Helping to prevent enterprise data leaks, even on employee-owned devices that can't be locked down.

- Reducing employee frustrations because of restrictive data management policies on enterprise-owned devices.

- Helping to maintain the ownership and control of your enterprise data.

- Helping control the network and data access and data sharing for apps that aren’t enterprise-aware.

### EDP-protection modes
You can set EDP to 1 of 4 protection and management modes:

|Mode|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Block |EDP looks for inappropriate data sharing practices and stops the employee from completing the action. This can include sharing enterprise data to non-enterprise-protected apps in addition to sharing enterprise data between apps or attempting to share outside of your organization’s network.|
|Override |EDP looks for inappropriate data sharing, warning employees if they do something deemed potentially unsafe. However, this management mode lets the employee override the policy and share the data, logging the action to your audit log, accessible through the [Reporting CSP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=746459). |
|Silent |EDP runs silently, logging inappropriate data sharing, without blocking anything that would’ve been prompted for employee interaction while in Override mode. Unallowed actions, like apps inappropriately trying to access a network resource or EDP-protected data, are still blocked.|
|Off |EDP is turned off and doesn't help to protect or audit your data.<p>After you turn off EDP, an attempt is made to decrypt any closed EDP-tagged files on the locally attached drives. |
<p>**Note**<br>For more info about setting your EDP-protection modes, see either [Create an enterprise data protection (EDP) policy using Intune](create-edp-policy-using-intune.md) or [Create and deploy an enterprise data protection (EDP) policy using Configuration Manager](create-edp-policy-using-sccm.md), depending on your management solution.

## Why use EDP?
EDP gives you a new way to manage data policy enforcement for apps and documents, along with the ability to remove access to enterprise data from both enterprise and personal devices (after enrollment in an enterprise management solution, like Intune).

-   **Change the way you think about data policy enforcement.** As an enterprise admin, you need to maintain compliance in your data policy and data access. EDP helps make sure that your enterprise data is protected on both corporate and employee-owned devices, even when the employee isn’t using the device. When employees create content on an enterprise-protected device, they can choose to save it as a work document. If it's a work document, it becomes locally-maintained as enterprise data.

-   **Manage your enterprise documents, apps, and encryption modes.**

    -   **Copying or downloading enterprise data.** When an employee or an app downloads content from a location like SharePoint, a network share, or an enterprise web location, while using an EDP-protected device, EDP encrypts the data on the device.

    -   **Using allowed apps.** Managed apps (apps that you've included on the protected apps list in your EDP policy) are allowed to access your enterprise data and will interact differently when used with unallowed, non-enterprise aware, or personal-only apps. For example, if EDP management is set to Block, your employees can copy and paste from one protected app to another protected app, but not to personal apps. Imagine an HR person wants to copy a job description from a protected app to the internal career website, an enterprise-protected location, but goofs and tries to paste into a personal app instead. The paste action fails and a notification pops up, saying that the app couldn’t paste because of a policy restriction. The HR person then correctly pastes to the career website without a problem.

    -   **Managed apps and restrictions.** With EDP you can control which apps can access and use your enterprise data. After adding an app to your protected apps list, the app is trusted with enterprise data. All apps not on this list are blocked from accessing your enterprise data, depending on your EDP management-mode.<p>You don’t have to modify line-of-business apps that never touch personal data to list them as protected apps; just include them in your protected apps list.

    -   **Deciding your level of data access.** EDP lets you block, allow overrides, or audit employees' data sharing actions. Blocking the action stops it immediately. Allowing overrides let the employee know there's a risk, but lets him or her continue to share the data while recording and auditing the action. Silent just logs the action without blocking anything that the employee could've overridden while using that setting; collecting info that can help you to see patterns of inappropriate sharing so you can take educative action or find apps that should be added to your protected apps list.

    -   **Data encryption at rest.** EDP helps protect enterprise data on local files and on removable media.<p>Apps such as Microsoft Word work with EDP to help continue your data protection across local files and removable media. These apps are being referred to as, enterprise aware. For example, if an employee opens EDP-encrypted content from Word, edits the content, and then tries to save the edited version with a different name, Word automatically applies EDP to the new document.

    -   **Helping prevent accidental data disclosure to public spaces.** EDP helps protect your enterprise data from being accidentally shared to public spaces, such as public cloud storage. For example, if Dropbox™ isn’t on your protected apps list, employees won’t be able to sync encrypted files to their personal cloud storage. Instead, if the employee stores the content to an app on your protected apps list, like Microsoft OneDrive for Business, the encrypted files can sync freely to the business cloud, while maintaining the encryption locally.

    -   **Helping prevent accidental data disclosure to removable media.** EDP helps prevent enterprise data from leaking when it's copied or transferred to removable media. For example, if an employee puts enterprise data on a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive that also has personal data, the enterprise data remains encrypted while the personal data doesn’t.

-   **Remove access to enterprise data from enterprise-protected devices.** EDP gives admins the ability to revoke enterprise data from one or many MDM-enrolled devices, while leaving personal data alone. This is a benefit when an employee leaves your company, or in the case of a stolen device. After determining that the data access needs to be removed, you can unenroll the device so when it connects to the network, the user's encryption key for the device is revoked and the enterprise data becomes unreadable.<p>**Note**<br>System Center Configuration Manager also allows you to revoke enterprise data. However, it does it by performing a factory reset of the device.
