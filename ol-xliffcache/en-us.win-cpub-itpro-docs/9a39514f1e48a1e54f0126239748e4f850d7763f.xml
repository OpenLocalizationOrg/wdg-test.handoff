Computer exemption is typically used when a company has computers that do not have to be encrypted, such as computers that are used in development or testing, or older computers that do not support BitLocker. In some cases, local law may also require that certain computers are not encrypted.\n\n[How to Manage User BitLocker Encryption Exemptions](how-to-manage-user-bitlocker-encryption-exemptions-mbam-25.md)\n\n## Understand the BitLocker Encryption Options and BitLocker Drive Encryption Items in Control Panel\n\n\nMBAM provides a custom control panel, called BitLocker Encryption Options, that appears under **System and Security**.
