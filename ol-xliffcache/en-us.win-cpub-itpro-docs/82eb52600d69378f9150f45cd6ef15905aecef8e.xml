 Windows 10\n-   Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview\n\nTo allow inbound Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) network traffic, use the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security node in the Group Policy Management MMC snap-in to create firewall rules. This type of rule allows ICMP requests and responses to be sent and received by computers on the network.\n\n**Administrative credentials**\n\nTo complete these procedures, you must be a member of the Domain Administrators group, or otherwise be delegated permissions to modify the GPOs.\n\nThis topic describes how to create a port rule that allows inbound ICMP network traffic. For other inbound port rule types, see:\n\n-   [Create an Inbound Port Rule](create-an-inbound-port-rule.md)\n\n-   [Create Inbound Rules to Support RPC](create-inbound-rules-to-support-rpc.md)\n\nTo create an inbound ICMP rule\n\n1.  [Open the Group Policy Management Console to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](open-the-group-policy-management-console-to-windows-firewall-with-advanced-security.md).\n\n2.  In the navigation pane, click **Inbound Rules**.\n\n3.  Click **Action**, and then click **New rule**.\n\n4.  On the **Rule Type** page of the New Inbound Rule Wizard, click **Custom**, and then click **Next**.\n\n5.  On the **Program** page, click **All programs**, and then click **Next**.\n\n6.  On the **Protocol and Ports** page, select **ICMPv4** or **ICMPv6** from the **Protocol type** list. If you use both IPv4 and IPv6 on your network, you must create a separate ICMP rule for each.\n\n7.  Click **Customize**.\n\n8.  In the **Customize ICMP Settings** dialog box, do one of the following:\n\n    -   To allow all ICMP network traffic, click **All ICMP types**, and then click **OK**.\n\n    -   To select one of the predefined ICMP types, click **Specific ICMP types**, and then select each type in the list that you want to allow. Click **OK**.\n\n    -   To select an ICMP type that does not appear in the list, click **Specific ICMP types**, select the **Type** number from the list, select the **Code** number from the list, click **Add**, and then select the newly created entry from the list. Click **OK**\n\n9.  Click **Next**.\n\n10. On the **Scope** page, you can specify that the rule applies only to network traffic to or from the IP addresses entered on this page. Configure as appropriate for your design, and then click **Next**.\n\n11. On the **Action** page, select **Allow the connection**, and then click **Next**.\n\n12. On the **Profile** page, select the network location types to which this rule applies, and then click **Next**.\n\n13. On the **Name** page, type a name and description for your rule, and then click **Finish**.\n"}
