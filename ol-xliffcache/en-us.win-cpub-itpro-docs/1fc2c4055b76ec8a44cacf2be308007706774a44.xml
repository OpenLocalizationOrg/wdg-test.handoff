To make the decision, consider that end users may have access to those tools. If support engineers will take the recovery image media to end users’ computers to diagnose issues, you may want to install all of the tools on the recovery image. If you plan to diagnose end user’s computers remotely, you may want to disable some of the tools, such as Disk Wipe and Registry Editor, and then enable other tools, including Remote Connection.\n\nWhen you create the DaRT recovery image, you will also specify whether you want to include additional drivers or files. Determine the locations of any additional drivers or files that you want to include on the DaRT recovery image.\n\nFor more information about the DaRT tools, see [Overview of the Tools in DaRT 10](overview-of-the-tools-in-dart-10.md). For more information about how to help create a secure recovery image, see [Security Considerations for DaRT 10](security-considerations-for-dart-10.md).\n\n## Prerequisites for the recovery image\n\n\nThe following items are required or recommended for creating the DaRT recovery image:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Prerequisite</strong></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><strong>Details</strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Windows 10 source files</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Required to create the DaRT recovery image.
