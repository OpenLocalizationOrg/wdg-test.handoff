# Completion Page


Always save App-V Package Accelerators and any associated installation media in a secure location on the network to protect App-V Package Accelerators and the installation files from being tampered with or becoming corrupted. Transforms can also contain password and user-specific information so that you must save App-V Package Accelerators in a secure location. You must also digitally sign the Package Accelerator after you create it so the publisher can be verified when the Package Accelerator is applied. A digital signature is an electronic security mark that can help indicate the publisher of the software and whether the package has been tampered with, after the transform was originally signed.
