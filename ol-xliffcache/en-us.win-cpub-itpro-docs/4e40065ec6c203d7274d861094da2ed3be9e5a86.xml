You can also use the **Additional Settings** page of the wizard to further restrict your employees from changing the proxy settings.\n\n![](images/wedge.gif) **To use the Proxy Settings page**\n\n1.  Check the **Enable proxy settings** box if you want to use proxy servers for any of your services.\n\n2.  Type the address of the proxy server you want to use for your services into the **Address of proxy** box. In most cases, a single proxy server is used for all of your services.<p>\nProxy locations that don’t begin with a protocol (like, http:// or ftp://) are assumed to be a CERN-type HTTP proxy. For example, the entry *proxy* is treated the same as the entry *http://proxy*.\n\n3.  Type the port for each service. The default value is *80*.\n\n4.  Check the **Use the same proxy server for all addresses** box to use the same proxy server settings for all of your services.\n\n5.  Type any services that shouldn’t use a proxy server into the **Do not use proxy server for addresses beginning with** box.<p>\nWhen filling out your exceptions, keep in mind:\n\n    -   Proxy bypass entries can begin with a protocol type, such as http://, https://, or ftp://. However, if a protocol type is used, the exception entry applies only to requests for that protocol.\n\n    -   Protocol values are not case sensitive and you can use a wildcard character (*) in place of zero or more characters.\n\n    -   You must use a semicolon between your entries.\n\n    -   This list is limited to **2064** characters.\n\n6.  Check the **Do not use proxy server for local (intranet) addresses** to bypass your proxy servers for all addresses on your intranet.\n\n7.  Click **Next** to go to the [Security and Privacy Settings](security-and-privacy-settings-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Automatic Configuration](auto-config-ieak11-wizard.md) page.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
