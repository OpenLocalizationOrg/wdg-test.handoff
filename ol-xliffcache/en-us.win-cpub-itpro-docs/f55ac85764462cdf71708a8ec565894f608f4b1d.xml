When you are determining the method that you will use, consider the advantages and disadvantages of each. Also, consider how you want to use DaRT in your enterprise.\n\n**Note**  \nYou might want to use more than one method in your organization. For example, you can boot into DaRT from a remote partition for most situations and have a USB flash drive available in case the end-user computer cannot connect to the network.\n\n \n\nThe following table shows some advantages and disadvantages of each method of using DaRT in your organization.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Method to Boot into DaRT</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Advantages</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Disadvantages</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>From a CD or DVD</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Supports scenarios in which the master boot record (MBR) is corrupted and you cannot access the hard disk.
