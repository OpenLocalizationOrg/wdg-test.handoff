This user right does not allow the user to list the contents of a folder. It only allows the user to traverse folders to access permitted files or subfolders.\n\nConstant: SeChangeNotifyPrivilege\n\n### Possible values\n\n-   User-defined list of accounts\n-   Not Defined\n\n### Best practices\n\n1.  Use access–based enumeration when you want to prevent users from seeing any folder or file to which they do not have access.\n2.  Use the default settings of this policy in most cases. If you change the settings, verify your intent through testing.\n\n### Location\n\nComputer Configuration\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Local Policies\\\\User Rights Assignment\n\n### Default values\n\nThe following table lists the actual and effective default policy values.

Local policy settings\n2.  Site policy settings\n3.  Domain policy settings\n4.

Permissions to files and folders are controlled though the appropriate configuration of file system access control lists (ACLs) because the ability to traverse the folder does not provide any Read or Write permissions to the user. The only scenario in which the default configuration could lead to a mishap would be if the administrator who configures permissions does not understand how this policy setting works. For example, the administrator might expect that users who are unable to access a folder are unable to access the contents of any child folders. Such a situation is unlikely, and, therefore, this vulnerability presents little risk.\n\n### Countermeasure\n\nOrganizations that are extremely concerned about security may want to remove the Everyone group, and perhaps the Users group, from the list of groups that have the **Bypass traverse checking** user right. Taking explicit control over traversal assignments can be an effective way to limit access to sensitive information. Access–based enumeration can also be used. If you use access–based enumeration, users cannot see any folder or file to which they do not have access. For more info about this feature, see [Access-based Enumeration](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=100745).\n\n### Potential impact\n\nThe Windows operating systems and many applications were designed with the expectation that anyone who can legitimately access the computer will have this user right. Therefore, we recommend that you thoroughly test any changes to assignments of the **Bypass traverse checking** user right before you make such changes to production systems. In particular, IIS requires this user right to be assigned to the Network Service, Local Service, IIS\\_WPG, IUSR\\_*&lt;ComputerName&gt;*, and IWAM\\_*&lt;ComputerName&gt;* accounts. (It must also be assigned to the ASPNET account through its membership in the Users group.) We recommend that you leave this policy setting at its default configuration.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [User Rights Assignment](user-rights-assignment.md)\n \n \n"}
