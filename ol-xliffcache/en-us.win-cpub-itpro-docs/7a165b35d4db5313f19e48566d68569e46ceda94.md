# Audit Account Lockout

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


Audit Account Lockout enables you to audit security events that are generated by a failed attempt to log on to an account that is locked out.

If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an account cannot log on to a computer because the account is locked out. Success audits record successful attempts and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.

Account lockout events are essential for understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.


            **Event volume**: Low.

This subcategory failure logon attempts, when account was already locked out.
