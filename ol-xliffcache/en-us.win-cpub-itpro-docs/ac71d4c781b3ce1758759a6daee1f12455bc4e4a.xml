Version\n\n\nWith Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.1, you can migrate your existing App-V 4.6 or App-V 5.0 infrastructure to the more flexible, integrated, and easier to manage App-V 5.1 infrastructure.\nHowever, you cannot migrate directly from App-V 4.x to App-V 5.1, you must migrate to App-V 5.0 first. For more information on migrating from App-V 4.x to App-V 5.0, see [Migrating from a Previous Version](migrating-from-a-previous-version-app-v-50.md)  \n\n**Note**  \nApp-V 5.1 packages are exactly the same as App-V 5.0 packages. There has been no change in the package format between the versions and therefore, there is no need to convert App-V 5.0 packages to App-V 5.1 packages.\n\nFor more information about the differences between App-V 4.6 and App-V 5.1, see the **Differences between App-V 4.6 and App-V 5.0 section** of [About App-V 5.0](about-app-v-50.md).\n\n \n\n## <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-pkgconvimprove\"></a>Improvements to the App-V 5.1 Package Converter\n\n\nYou can now use the package converter to convert App-V 4.6 packages that contain scripts, and registry information and scripts from source .osd files are now included in package converter output.\n\nYou can also use the `–OSDsToIncludeInPackage` parameter with the `ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyPackage` cmdlet to specify which .osd files’ information is converted and placed within the new package.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">New in App-V 5.1</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Prior to App-V 5.1</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>New .xml files are created corresponding to the .osd files associated with a package; these files include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>environment variables</p></li>\n<li><p>shortcuts</p></li>\n<li><p>file type associations</p></li>\n<li><p>registry information</p></li>\n<li><p>scripts</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can now choose to add information from a subset of the .osd files in the source directory to the package using the <code>-OSDsToIncludeInPackage</code> parameter.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Registry information and scripts included in .osd files associated with a package were not included in package converter output.</p>\n<p>The package converter would populate the new package with information from all of the .osd files in the source directory.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n### Example conversion statement\n\nTo understand the new process, review the following example `ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyPackage` package converter statement.\n\n**If the source directory (\\\\\\\\OldPkgStore\\\\ContosoApp) includes the following:**\n\n-   ContosoApp.sft\n\n-   ContosoApp.msi\n\n-   ContosoApp.sprj\n\n-   ContosoApp\\_manifest.xml\n\n-   X.osd\n\n-   Y.osd\n\n-   Z.osd\n\n**And you run this command:**\n\n``` syntax\nConvertFrom-AppvLegacyPackage –SourcePath \\\\OldPkgStore\\ContosoApp\\ \n-DestinationPath \\\\NewPkgStore\\ContosoApp\\\n-OSDsToIncludeInPackage X.osd,Y.osd\n```\n\n**The following is created in the destination directory (\\\\\\\\NewPkgStore\\\\ContosoApp):**\n\n-   ContosoApp.appv\n\n-   ContosoApp.msi\n\n-   ContosoApp\\_DeploymentConfig.xml\n\n-   ContosoApp\\_UserConfig.xml\n\n-   X\\_Config.xml\n\n-   Y\\_Config.xml\n\n-   Z\\_Config.xml\n\n**In the above example:**\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n<col width=\"25%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">These Source directory files…</th>\n<th align=\"left\">…are converted to these Destination directory files…</th>\n<th align=\"left\">…and will contain these items</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><ul>\n<li><p>X.osd</p></li>\n<li><p>Y.osd</p></li>\n<li><p>Z.osd</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><ul>\n<li><p>X_Config.xml</p></li>\n<li><p>Y_Config.xml</p></li>\n<li><p>Z_Config.xml</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><ul>\n<li><p>Environment variables</p></li>\n<li><p>Shortcuts</p></li>\n<li><p>File type associations</p></li>\n<li><p>Registry information</p></li>\n<li><p>Scripts</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Each .osd file is converted to a separate, corresponding .xml file that contains the items listed here in App-V 5.1 deployment configuration format.

It could possibly be a hard-coded path. Convert the path.\n\n**Note**  \nIt is recommended that you use the App-V 5.1 sequencer for converting critical applications or applications that need to take advantage of features. See, [How to Sequence a New Application with App-V 5.1](how-to-sequence-a-new-application-with-app-v-51-beta-gb18030.md).\n\nIf a converted package does not open after you convert it, it is also recommended that you re-sequence the application using the App-V 5.1 sequencer.\n\n \n\n[How to Convert a Package Created in a Previous Version of App-V](how-to-convert-a-package-created-in-a-previous-version-of-app-v51.md)\n\n## Migrating Clients\n\n\nThe following table displays the recommended method for upgrading clients.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Task</th>\n<th align=\"left\">More Information</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Upgrade your environment to the latest version of App-V 4.6</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[Application Virtualization Deployment and Upgrade Considerations](../appv-v4/application-virtualization-deployment-and-upgrade-considerations-copy.md).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Install the App-V 5.1 client with co-existence enabled.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>[How to Deploy the App-V 4.6 and the App-V 5.1 Client on the Same Computer](how-to-deploy-the-app-v-46-and-the-app-v--51-client-on-the-same-computer.md).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Sequence and roll out App-V 5.1 packages.

Additionally, when you sequence a package, you must configure the Managing Authority setting, which is in the **User Configuration** is located in the **User Configuration** section.\n\n \n\n## Migrating the App-V 5.1 Server Full Infrastructure\n\n\nThere is no direct method to upgrade to a full App-V 5.1 infrastructure.
