When end users sign in to a computer that is required to be encrypted, they receive a notification that their computer is going to be encrypted. They can select **Request Exemption** and postpone the encryption by selecting **Postpone**, or they can select **Start Encryption** to accept the BitLocker encryption.\n\n    **Note**  \n    Selecting **Request Exemption** postpones the BitLocker protection until the maximum time that is set in the User Exemption Policy.\n\n     \n\n2.

Depending on how the **Configure User Exemption Policy** is configured, users are provided with one or more of the following contact methods:\n\n    -   Phone number\n\n    -   Webpage URL\n\n    -   Mailing address\n\n3.  After the exemption request is received, the MBAM administrator decides whether to add the user to the BitLocker Exemption Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) group.\n\n4.

If the MBAM administrator rejects the exemption request, the exemption request option is deactivated, which prevents the user from requesting the exemption again.\n\n**To exempt a user from BitLocker Drive Encryption**\n\n1.  Create an AD DS security group that will be used to manage user exemptions from BitLocker encryption requirements.\n\n2.  Create a Group Policy Object by using the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring Group Policy Templates.\n\n3.  Associate the Group Policy Object with the AD DS group that you created in the previous step. The policy settings to exempt users are located at: **UserConfiguration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components** &gt; **MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.\n\n4.  To the security group you created for BitLocker exempted users, add the names of the users who are requesting an exemption.\n\n    When a user signs in to a computer controlled by BitLocker, the MBAM Client checks the User Exemption Policy setting. If the computer is already encrypted, BitLocker protection is not suspended. If the computer is not encrypted, MBAM does not prompt the user to encrypt.\n\n    **Important**  \n    Shared computer scenarios require special consideration when you are using BitLocker user exemptions. If a non-exempt user signs in to a computer that is shared with an exempt user, the computer may be encrypted.\n\n     \n\n    **Got a suggestion for MBAM**?
