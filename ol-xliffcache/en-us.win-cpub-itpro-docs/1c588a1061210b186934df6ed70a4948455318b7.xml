The following instructions explain how to create an Office 2013 App-V package with Volume Licensing or Subscription Licensing.\n\nCreate Office 2013 App-V packages on 64-bit Windows computers. Once created, the Office 2013 App-V package will run on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers.\n\n### Download the Office Deployment Tool\n\nOffice 2013 App-V Packages are created using the Office Deployment Tool, which generates an Office 2013 App-V Package. The package cannot be created or modified through the App-V sequencer. To begin package creation:\n\n1.  Download the [Office Deployment Tool for Click-to-Run](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36778).\n\n2.  Run the .exe file and extract its features into the desired location. To make this process easier, you can create a shared network folder where the features will be saved.\n\n    Example: \\\\\\\\Server\\\\Office2013\n\n3.  Check that a setup.exe and a configuration.xml file exist and are in the location you specified.\n\n### Download Office 2013 applications\n\nAfter you download the Office Deployment Tool, you can use it to get the latest Office 2013 applications. After getting the Office applications, you create the Office 2013 App-V package.\n\nThe XML file that is included in the Office Deployment Tool specifies the product details, such as the languages and Office applications included.\n\n1.  **Customize the sample XML configuration file:** Use the sample XML configuration file that you downloaded with the Office Deployment Tool to customize the Office applications:\n\n    1.  Open the sample XML file in Notepad or your favorite text editor.\n\n    2.  With the sample configuration.xml file open and ready for editing, you can specify products, languages, and the path to which you save the Office 2013 applications. The following is a basic example of the configuration.xml file:\n\n        ``` syntax\n        <Configuration>\n           <Add SourcePath= ”\\\\Server\\Office2013” OfficeClientEdition=\"32\" >\n            <Product ID=\"O365ProPlusRetail \">\n              <Language ID=\"en-us\" />\n            </Product>\n            <Product ID=\"VisioProRetail\">\n              <Language ID=\"en-us\" />\n            </Product>\n          </Add>  \n        </Configuration>\n        ```\n\n        **Note**  \n        The configuration XML is a sample XML file. The file includes lines that are commented out. You can “uncomment” these lines to customize additional settings with the file.\n\n         \n\n        The above XML configuration file specifies that Office 2013 ProPlus 32-bit edition, including Visio ProPlus, will be downloaded in English to the \\\\\\\\server\\\\Office 2013, which is the location where Office applications will be saved to. Note that the Product ID of the applications will not affect the final licensing of Office. Office 2013 App-V packages with various licensing can be created from the same applications through specifying licensing in a later stage. The table below summarizes the customizable attributes and elements of XML file:\n\n        <table>\n        <colgroup>\n        <col width=\"33%\" />\n        <col width=\"33%\" />\n        <col width=\"33%\" />\n        </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n        <tr class=\"header\">\n        <th align=\"left\">Input</th>\n        <th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n        <th align=\"left\">Example</th>\n        </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Add element</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Specifies the products and languages to include in the package.</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>N/A</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>OfficeClientEdition (attribute of Add element)</p></td>\n        <td align=\"left\"><p>Specifies the edition of Office 2013 product to use: 32-bit or 64-bit.

Complete the steps that correspond to your licensing model.\n\n**Summary of what you’ll need to do:**\n\n-   Create the Office 2013 App-V packages on 64-bit Windows computers. However, the package will run on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers.\n\n-   Create an Office App-V package for either Subscription Licensing package or Volume Licensing by using the Office Deployment Tool, and then modify the CustomConfig.xml configuration file.\n\n    The following table summarizes the values you need to enter in the CustomConfig.xml file for the licensing model you’re using.

To use Office plug-ins, you must use the App-V Sequencer to create a separate package that contains just the plug-ins. You cannot use the Office Deployment Tool to create the plug-ins package. You then create a connection group that contains the Office package and the plug-ins package, as described in the following steps.\n\n**To enable plug-ins for Office App-V packages**\n\n1.  Add a Connection Group through App-V Server, System Center Configuration Manager, or a PowerShell cmdlet.\n\n2.  Sequence your plug-ins using the App-V 5.0 Sequencer. Ensure that Office 2013 is installed on the computer being used to sequence the plug-in. It is recommended you use Office 365 ProPlus(non-virtual) on the sequencing computer when you sequence Office 2013 plug-ins.\n\n3.  Create an App-V 5.0 package that includes the desired plug-ins.\n\n4.  Add a Connection Group through App-V server, System Center Configuration Manager, or a PowerShell cmdlet.\n\n5.  Add the Office 2013 App-V package and the plug-ins package you sequenced to the Connection Group you created.\n\n    **Important**  \n    The order of the packages in the Connection Group determines the order in which the package contents are merged. In your Connection group descriptor file, add the Office 2013 App-V package first, and then add the plug-in App-V package.\n\n     \n\n6.  Ensure that both packages are published to the target computer and that the plug-in package is published globally to match the global settings of the published Office 2013 App-V package.\n\n7.  Verify that the Deployment Configuration File of the plug-in package has the same settings that the Office 2013 App-V package has.\n\n    Since the Office 2013 App-V package is integrated with the operating system, the plug-in package settings should match. You can search the Deployment Configuration File for “COM Mode” and ensure that your plug-ins package has that value set as “Integrated” and that both \"InProcessEnabled\" and \"OutOfProcessEnabled\" match the settings of the Office 2013 App-V package you published.\n\n8.  Open the Deployment Configuration File and set the value for **Objects Enabled** to **false**.\n\n9.  If you made any changes to the Deployment Configuration file after sequencing, ensure that the plug-in package is published with the file.\n\n10. Ensure that the Connection Group you created is enabled onto your desired computer. The Connection Group created will likely “pend” if the Office 2013 App-V package is in use when the Connection Group is enabled. If that happens, you have to reboot to successfully enable the Connection Group.\n\n11. After you successfully publish both packages and enable the Connection Group, start the target Office 2013 application and verify that the plug-in you published and added to the connection group works as expected.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-disable-office-apps\"></a>Disabling Office 2013 applications\n\nYou may want to disable specific applications in your Office App-V package. For instance, you can disable Access, but leave all other Office application main available. When you disable an application, the end user will no longer see the shortcut for that application. You do not have to re-sequence the application. When you change the Deployment Configuration File after the Office 2013 App-V package has been published, you will save the changes, add the Office 2013 App-V package, and then republish it with the new Deployment Configuration File to apply the new settings to Office 2013 App-V Package applications.\n\n**Note**  \nTo exclude specific Office applications (for example, Access and InfoPath) when you create the App-V package with the Office Deployment Tool, use the **ExcludeApp** setting. For more information, see [Reference for Click-to-Run configuration.xml file](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj219426.aspx).\n\n \n\n**To disable an Office 2013 application**\n\n1.  Open a Deployment Configuration File with a text editor such as **Notepad** and search for “Applications.\"\n\n2.  Search for the Office application you want to disable, for example, Access 2013.\n\n3.  Change the value of \"Enabled\" from \"true\" to \"false.\"\n\n4.  Save the Deployment Configuration File.\n\n5.  Add the Office 2013 App-V Package with the new Deployment Configuration File.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    <Application Id=\"[{AppVPackageRoot)]\\officefl5\\INFOPATH.EXE\" Enabled=\"true\">\n      <VisualElements>\n        <Name>InfoPath Filler 2013</Name>\n        <Icon />\n        <Description />\n      </VisualElements>\n    </Application>\n    <Application Id=\"[{AppVPackageRoot}]\\officel5\\lync.exe\" Enabled=\"true\">\n      <VisualElements>\n        <Name>Lync 2013</Name>\n        <Icon />\n        <Description />\n      </VisualElements>\n    </Application>\n    <Application Id=\"[(AppVPackageRoot}]\\office15\\MSACCESS.EXE\" Enabled=\"true\">\n      <VisualElements>\n        <Name>Access 2013</Name>\n        <Icon />\n        <Description />\n      </VisualElements>\n    </Application>\n    ```\n\n6.  Re-add the Office 2013 App-V package, and then republish it with the new Deployment Configuration File to apply the new settings to Office 2013 App-V Package applications.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-disable-shortcuts\"></a>Disabling Office 2013 shortcuts\n\nYou may want to disable shortcuts for certain Office applications instead of unpublishing or removing the package. The following example shows how to disable shortcuts for Microsoft Access.\n\n**To disable shortcuts for Office 2013 applications**\n\n1.  Open a Deployment Configuration File in Notepad and search for “Shortcuts”.\n\n2.  To disable certain shortcuts, delete or comment out the specific shortcuts you don’t want. You must keep the subsystem present and enabled. For example, in the example below, delete the Microsoft Access shortcuts, while keeping the subsystems &lt;shortcut&gt; &lt;/shortcut&gt; intact to disable the Microsoft Access shortcut.\n\n    ``` syntax\n    Shortcuts \n\n    -->\n     <Shortcuts Enabled=\"true\">\n      <Extensions>\n        <Extension Category=\"AppV.Shortcut\">\n          <Shortcut>\n           <File>[{Common Programs}]\\Microsoft Office 2013\\Access 2013.lnk</File>\n           <Target>[{AppvPackageRoot}])office15\\MSACCESS.EXE</Target>\n           <Icon>[{Windows}]\\Installer\\{90150000-000F-0000-0000-000000FF1CE)\\accicons.exe.Ø.ico</Icon>\n           <Arguments />\n           <WorkingDirectory />\n           <AppuserModelId>Microsoft.Office.MSACCESS.EXE.15</AppUserModelId>\n           <AppUsermodelExcludeFroeShowInNewInstall>true</AppUsermodelExcludeFroeShowInNewInstall>\n           <Description>Build a professional app quickly to manage data.</Description>\n           <ShowCommand>l</ShowCommand>\n           <ApplicationId>[{AppVPackageRoot}]\\officel5\\MSACCESS.EXE</ApplicationId>\n        </Shortcut>\n    ```\n\n3.  Save the Deployment Configuration File.\n\n4.  Republish Office 2013 App-V Package with new Deployment Configuration File.\n\nMany additional settings can be changed through modifying the Deployment Configuration for App-V packages, for example, file type associations, Virtual File System, and more. For additional information on how to use Deployment Configuration Files to change App-V package settings, refer to the additional resources section at the end of this document.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-manage-office-pkg-upgrd\"></a>Managing Office 2013 package upgrades\n\nTo upgrade an Office 2013 package, use the Office Deployment Tool. To upgrade a previously deployed Office 2013 package, perform the following steps.\n\n**How to upgrade a previously deployed Office 2013 package**\n\n1.  Create a new Office 2013 package through the Office Deployment Tool that uses the most recent Office 2013 application software. The most recent Office 2013 bits can always be obtained through the download stage of creating an Office 2013 App-V Package. The newly created Office 2013 package will have the most recent updates and a new Version ID. All packages created using the Office Deployment Tool have the same lineage.\n\n    **Note**  \n    Office App-V packages have two Version IDs:\n\n    -   An Office 2013 App-V Package Version ID that is unique across all packages created using the Office Deployment Tool.\n\n    -   A second App-V Package Version ID, x.x.x.x for example, in the AppX manifest that will only change if there is a new version of Office itself. For example, if a new Office 2013 release with upgrades is available, and a package is created through the Office Deployment Tool to incorporate these upgrades, the X.X.X.X version ID will change to reflect that the Office version itself has changed. The App-V server will use the X.X.X.X version ID to differentiate this package and recognize that it contains new upgrades to the previously published package, and as a result, publish it as an upgrade to the existing Office 2013 package.\n\n     \n\n2.  Globally publish the newly created Office 2013 App-V Packages onto computers where you would like to apply the new updates. Since the new package has the same lineage of the older Office 2013 App-V Package, publishing the new package with the updates will only apply the new changes to the old package, and thus will be fast.\n\n3.  Upgrades will be applied in the same manner of any globally published App-V Packages. Because applications will probably be in use, upgrades might be delayed until the computer is rebooted.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-manage-office-lic-upgrd\"></a>Managing Office 2013 licensing upgrades\n\nIf a new Office 2013 App-V Package has a different license than the Office 2013 App-V Package currently deployed. For instance, the Office 2013 package deployed is a subscription based Office 2013 and the new Office 2013 package is Volume Licensing based, the following instructions must be followed to ensure smooth licensing upgrade:\n\n**How to upgrade an Office 2013 License**\n\n1.  Unpublish the already deployed Office 2013 Subscription Licensing App-V package.\n\n2.  Remove the unpublished Office 2013 Subscription Licensing App-V package.\n\n3.  Restart the computer.\n\n4.  Add the new Office 2013 App-V Package Volume Licensing.\n\n5.  Publish the added Office 2013 App-V Package with Volume Licensing.\n\nAn Office 2013 App-V Package with your chosen licensing will be successfully deployed.\n\n### <a href=\"\" id=\"bkmk-deploy-visio-project\"></a>Deploying Visio 2013 and Project 2013 with Office\n\nThe following table describes the requirements and options for deploying Visio 2013 and Project 2013 with Office.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Task</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>How do I package and publish Visio 2013 and Project 2013 with Office?</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>You must include Visio 2013 and Project 2013 in the same package with Office.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t deploying Office, you can create a package that contains Visio and/or Project, as long as you follow the [Virtualizing Microsoft Office 2013 for Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0](../solutions/virtualizing-microsoft-office-2013-for-application-virtualization--app-v--50-solutions.md#bkmk-pkg-pub-reqs).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>How can I deploy Visio 2013 and Project 2013 to specific users?</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Use one of the following methods:</p>\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">If you want to...</th>\n<th align=\"left\">...then use this method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Create two different packages and deploy each one to a different group of users</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Create and deploy the following packages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A package that contains only Office - deploy to computers whose users need only Office.</p></li>\n<li><p>A package that contains Office, Visio, and Project - deploy to computers whose users need all three applications.</p></li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>If you want only one package for the whole organization, or if you have users who share computers:</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Create a package that contains Office, Visio, and Project.</p></li>\n<li><p>Deploy the package to all users.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use [Microsoft AppLocker](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd723678.aspx) to prevent specific users from using Visio and Project.</p></li>\n</ol></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## Additional resources\n\n\n**Office 2013 App-V 5.0 Packages 5.0 Additional Resources**\n\n[Office Deployment Tool for Click-to-Run](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=330672)\n\n[Supported scenarios for deploying Microsoft Office as a sequenced App-V Package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=330680)\n\n**Office 2010 App-V 5.0 Packages**\n\n[Microsoft Office 2010 Sequencing Kit for Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=330681)\n\n[Known issues when you create or use an App-V 5.0 Office 2010 package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=330682)\n\n[How to sequence Microsoft Office 2010 in Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=330676)\n\n**Connection Groups**\n\n[Deploying Connection Groups in Microsoft App-V v5](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=330683)\n\n[Managing Connection Groups](managing-connection-groups.md)\n\n**Dynamic Configuration**\n\n[About App-V 5.0 Dynamic Configuration](about-app-v-50-dynamic-configuration.md)\n\n## Got a suggestion for App-V?\n\n\nAdd or vote on suggestions [here](http://appv.uservoice.com/forums/280448-microsoft-application-virtualization).
