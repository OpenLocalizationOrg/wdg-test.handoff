You must uninstall any previous versions of the Sequencer and then install Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer 4.5. However, Virtual applications created using an earlier version of the Sequencer can be opened and edited using Sequencer 4.5.\n\n**To upgrade the Sequencer on computers running Windows Vista**\n\n1.  To uninstall previous installations of the Sequencer, open Control Panel and select **Programs and Features**. Select the older version from the list, and then click **Uninstall**. To confirm the uninstall, click **Yes** in the **Programs and Features** dialog box.\n\n2.  After you have completed uninstalling the previous Sequencer version, install Application Virtualization Sequencer 4.5. For more information about installing Sequencer 4.5, see [How to Install the Application Virtualization Sequencer](how-to-install-the-application-virtualization-sequencer.md).\n\n**To upgrade the Sequencer on computers running Windows XP**\n\n1.  To uninstall previous installations of the Sequencer, open Control Panel and select **Add or Remove Programs**. Select the older version from the list, and then click **Remove**.
