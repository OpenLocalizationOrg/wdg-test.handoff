AGPM provides comprehensive change control and improved management of Group Policy Objects (GPOs).\n\nUsing AGPM, you can do these tasks:\n\n-   Perform offline editing of GPOs so that you can create and test them before you deploy them to a production environment.\n\n-   Maintain multiple versions of a GPO in a central archive so that you can roll back if a problem occurs.\n\n-   Share the responsibility for editing, approving, and reviewing GPOs among multiple people by using role-based delegation.\n\n-   Eliminate the danger of multiple Group Policy administrators overwriting one another's work by using the check-in and check-out capability for GPOs.\n\n-   Analyze changes to a GPO, comparing it to another GPO or another version of the same GPO by using difference reporting.\n\n-   Simplify creating new GPOs by using GPO templates, storing common policy settings and preference settings to use as starting points for new GPOs.\n\n-   Delegate access to the production environment.\n\n-   Search for GPOs with specific attributes and filter the list of GPOs displayed.\n\n-   Export a GPO to a file so that you can copy it from a domain in a test forest to a domain in a production forest.\n\nAGPM adds a **Change Control** folder under each domain displayed in the GPMC, in addition to a **History** tab for each GPO and Group Policy link displayed in the GPMC.\n\n-   [Overview of Advanced Group Policy Management](overview-of-advanced-group-policy-management-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Best Practices for Version Control](best-practices-for-version-control-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Checklist: Administer the AGPM Server and Archive](checklist-administer-the-agpm-server-and-archive-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Checklist: Create, Edit, and Deploy a GPO](checklist-create-edit-and-deploy-a-gpo-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Search and Filter the List of GPOs](search-and-filter-the-list-of-gpos.md)\n\n-   [Performing AGPM Administrator Tasks](performing-agpm-administrator-tasks-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Performing Editor Tasks](performing-editor-tasks-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Performing Approver Tasks](performing-approver-tasks-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Performing Reviewer Tasks](performing-reviewer-tasks-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [Troubleshooting AGPM](troubleshooting-agpm-agpm40.md)\n\n-   [User Interface: Advanced Group Policy Management](user-interface-advanced-group-policy-management-agpm40.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
