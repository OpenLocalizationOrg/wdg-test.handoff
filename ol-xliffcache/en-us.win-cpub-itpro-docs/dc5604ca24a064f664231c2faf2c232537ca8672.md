# About App-V 5.0


App-V 5.0 provides an improved integrated platform, more flexible virtualization, and powerful management for virtualized applications. For more information see the [App-V 5.0 Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=325265) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=325265).

## <a href="" id="what-s-new-"></a>What’s new?


The following list displays what is new with App-V 5.0:

-   
            **IT Diagnostics and Monitoring** - App-V 5.0 enhances the ability to generate reporting information about computers running the App-V 5.0 client and virtualized packages.

-   
            **End-to-End Programmability** - Leveraging PowerShell 3.0, App-V 5.0 offers a complete programmability solution for packaging, client and server operations.

-   
            **Simple and Effective Client Console** - App-V 5.0 offers a modern client console designed to simplify the top end user and Tier 1 support engineer scenarios.

-   
            **Virtual Application Extensions** - App-V 5.0 virtual application extensions enable virtual packages to run as if they are installed locally.

-   
            **Local Drive Creation** - App-V 5.0 no longer requires a dedicated local drive letter for virtual application deployment.

-   
            **Shared Content Store** – The App-V 5.0 shared content store offers similar functionality to the streaming server available in previous versions of App-V. It also requires less disk space and updates to virtual applications are available as soon as the new version is ready.

-   
            **Connection Groups** - App-V 5.0 connection groups allow you to connect and run virtual applications interactively.
