On the computer that hosts the share, use Group Policy to allow connections from anonymous users.\n\nThese steps are not necessary if the computers where you deploy inventory-collector packages are running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10.\n\nIf you choose to have distributed logging with a subsequent step of moving log files to your central share, move the files to the central share before processing the files. You can move the files manually or use a technology like Distributed File-System Replication (DFSR).\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n[ACT Tools, Packages, and Services](act-tools-packages-and-services.md)\n\n[ACT Database Configuration](act-database-configuration.md)\n\n[ACT Database Migration](act-database-migration.md)\n\n[ACT LPS Share Permissions](act-lps-share-permissions.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
