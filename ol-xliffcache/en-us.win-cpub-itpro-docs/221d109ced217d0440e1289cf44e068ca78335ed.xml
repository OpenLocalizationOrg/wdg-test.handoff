10\n\nProvides an introduction to the settings under **Security Options** of the local security policies and links to information about each setting.\n\nThe **Security Options** contain the following groupings of security policy settings that allow you to configure the behavior of the local computer. Some of these policies can be included in a Group Policy Object and distributed over your organization.\n\nIf you edit policy settings locally on a device, you will affect the settings on only that one device. If you configure the settings in a Group Policy Object (GPO), the settings apply to all devices that are subject to that GPO.\n\nFor info about setting security policies, see [Configure security policy settings](how-to-configure-security-policy-settings.md).\n\n## In this section\n\n| Topic | Description |\n| - | - |\n| [Accounts: Administrator account
