Right-click the **Change Control** node, and then click **New Controlled GPO**.\n\n3.  In the **New Controlled GPO** dialog box:\n\n    1.  Type a name for the new GPO.\n\n    2.  Optional: Type a comment for the new GPO to be displayed in the **History** for the GPO.\n\n    3.  To immediately deploy the new GPO to the production environment, click **Create live**. To create the new GPO offline without immediately deploying it, click **Create offline**.\n\n    4.  Select the GPO template to use as a starting point for the new GPO.\n\n    5.
