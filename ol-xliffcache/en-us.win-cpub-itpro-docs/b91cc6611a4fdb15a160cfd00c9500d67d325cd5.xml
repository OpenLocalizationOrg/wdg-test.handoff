It also contains links to subordinate checklists that will help you complete the tasks that are required to implement this design.\n\n>**Note:**  Complete the tasks in this checklist in order. When a reference link takes you to a procedure, return to this topic after you complete the steps in that procedure so that you can proceed with the remaining tasks in this checklist.\n\nThe procedures in this section use the Group Policy MMC snap-ins to configure the GPOs, but you can also use Windows PowerShell to configure GPOs.
