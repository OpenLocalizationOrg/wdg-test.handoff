The BitLocker client can be integrated into an organization by deploying the client through tools like Active Directory Domain Services or by directly encrypting the client computers as part of the initial imaging process.\n\nDepending on when you deploy the MBAM Client, you can enable BitLocker encryption on a computer in your organization either before or after the end user receives the computer. To control this timing, you configure Group Policy and deploy the MBAM Client software by using an enterprise software deployment system.\n\nYou can use either or both of these methods in your organization. If you use both methods, you can improve compliance, reporting, and key recovery support.\n\n## Deploy the MBAM Client to desktop or laptop computers\n\n\nAfter you have configured Group Policy, you can deploy the MBAM Client installation Windows Installer files to target computers. You can do this by use of an enterprise software deployment system product like Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager or Active Directory Domain Services. The two available MBAM Client installation Windows Installer files are MBAMClient-64bit.msi and MBAMClient-32bit.msi. These files are provided with the MBAM software.

This situation enables administrators to install the MBAM Client to manage BitLocker encryption on each computer before any user data is written to the computer. This approach helps to ensure that computers are properly encrypted because the administrator performs the action without reliance on end-user action. A key assumption for this scenario is that the policy of the organization installs a corporate Windows image before the computer is delivered to the user.\n\n[How to Deploy the MBAM Client as Part of a Windows Deployment](how-to-deploy-the-mbam-client-as-part-of-a-windows-deployment-mbam-1.md)\n\n## Other resources for deploying the MBAM Client\n\n\n[Deploying MBAM 1.0](deploying-mbam-10.md)\n\n[Planning for MBAM 1.0 Client Deployment](planning-for-mbam-10-client-deployment.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
