Considerations](mbam-25-security-considerations.md).\n\n## Using certificates to secure MBAM websites\n\n\nWe recommend that you use a certificate to secure the communication between the:\n\n-   MBAM Client and the web services\n\n-   Browser and the Administration and Monitoring Website and the Self-Service Portal websites\n\nFor information about requesting and installing a certificate, see [Configuring Internet Server Certificates](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731977.aspx).\n\n**Note**  \nYou can configure the websites and web services on different servers only if you are using Windows PowerShell. If you use the MBAM Server Configuration wizard to configure the websites, you must configure the websites and the web services on the same server.\n\n \n\nTo secure the communication between the web services and the databases, we also recommend that you force encryption in SQL Server. For information about securing all connections to SQL Server, including communication between the web services and SQL Server, see [MBAM 2.5 Security Considerations](mbam-25-security-considerations.md#bkmk-secure-databases).\n\n## Registering SPNs for the application pool account\n\n\nTo enable the MBAM Servers to authenticate communication from the Administration and Monitoring Website and the Self-Service Portal, you must register a Service Principal Name (SPN) for the host name under the domain account that you are using for the web application pool.\n\nThis topic contains instructions on how to register SPNs for the following types of host names:\n\n-   Fully qualified domain name\n\n-   NetBIOS name\n\n-   Virtual name\n\n### Before you create SPNs for an initial MBAM installation\n\nReview the information in the following table before you start creating SPNs.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Task or item</th>\n<th align=\"left\">More information</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Create a service account in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>The service account is a user account that you create in AD DS to provide security for the MBAM websites.
