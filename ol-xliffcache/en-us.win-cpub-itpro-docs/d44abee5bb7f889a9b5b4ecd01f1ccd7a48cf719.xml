You determine the e-mail address or addresses to which notifications are sent, as well as the alias from which notifications are sent.\n\nA user account with the AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role or necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in \"Additional considerations\" in this topic.\n\n**To configure e-mail notification for AGPM**\n\n1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.\n\n2.  In the details pane, click the **Domain Delegation** tab.\n\n3.  In the **From** field, type the e-mail alias for AGPM from which notifications should be sent.\n\n4.  In the **To** field, type a comma-delimited list of e-mail addresses of Approvers who should receive requests for approval.\n\n5.  In the **SMTP server** field, type a valid SMTP mail server.\n\n6.  In the **User name** and **Password** fields, type the credentials of a user with access to the SMTP service.\n\n7.  Click **Apply**.\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n-   By default, you must be an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Modify Options** permissions for the domain.\n\n-   E-mail notification for AGPM is a domain-level setting. You can provide different Approver e-mail addresses or AGPM e-mail aliases on each domain's **Domain Delegation** tab, or use the same e-mail addresses throughout your environment.\n\n### Additional references\n\n-   [Performing AGPM Administrator Tasks](performing-agpm-administrator-tasks.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
