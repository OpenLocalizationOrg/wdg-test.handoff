events that show usage of non-sensitive privileges. This is the list of non-sensitive privileges:\n\n-   Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller\n\n-   Add workstations to domain\n\n-   Adjust memory quotas for a process\n\n-   Bypass traverse checking\n\n-   Change the system time\n\n-   Change the time zone\n\n-   Create a page file\n\n-   Create global objects\n\n-   Create permanent shared objects\n\n-   Create symbolic links\n\n-   Force shutdown from a remote system\n\n-   Increase a process working set\n\n-   Increase scheduling priority\n\n-   Lock pages in memory\n\n-   Modify an object label\n\n-   Perform volume maintenance tasks\n\n-   Profile single process\n\n-   Profile system performance\n\n-   Remove computer from docking station\n\n-   Shut down the system\n\n-   Synchronize directory service data\n\nThis subcategory also contains informational events from filesystem Transaction Manager.\n\nIf you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when a non-sensitive privilege is called.
